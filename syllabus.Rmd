### Quizzes
Six times during the semester I will administer an in class quiz over the assigned readings that day. They are designed to incentivize reading, so they will be unannounced.  I will drop your lowest quiz grade.  Each quiz will be administered at the start of class.  Because I drop the lowest quiz, no make-ups will be administered.

### Short essays
Twice during the semester you will submit a 1 page (not including works cited) analytical essay of an issue discussed (or to be discussed) in class. The topic can NOT relate to your midterm or final paper, and must cite at least two papers/articles not discussed in class. 

### Research papers
You will be submitting more detailed research papers between 3 and 4 pages in length NOT INCLUDING WORKS CITED.  It can be on any U.S. current economic issue of your choosing. Your paper should have a strong thesis/hypothesis, which you will analyze and support by rigorous and cogent appeal to empirical evidence gathered andinterpreted by you and others

### Presentation
You will be presenting the findings from your final paper to the class. Presentations will last 10-15 minutes and you MUST respond to audience questions/criticisms. You will be allowed to bring up notes to reference in response to questions, but the main body of the presentation must be done without notes. You must also have slides for the presentation.
