## Roadmap

- Self-stereotyping
- Role-model effect

## Self-stereotyping and the contribution of ideas

- Many decisions are made by groups
    + Corporate boards, team projects
- The quality of the group decision depends upon what information is elicited from group members 
- Contribution stage is important: group decision can only be as good as its best inputs

## Previous evidence
- Survey evidence from business sector, including Heath, Flynn, and Davis Holt in Harvard Business Review (2014)
    + Men reported seeing a female colleague get rattled or remain silent even when she was the expert at the table
    + Women reported that they feel less effective in meetings; say that their voices are ignored or drowned out.
    
- Most of this previous work involves natural, unstructured settings 
    + Speaking up and being listened to are closely intertwined; we want to isolate the willingness to contribute an idea
    
## Discussion
- Why do we care if women are less likely to contribute ideas?

<!--
systematic biases in what viewpoints are heard
-->
    
## Experimental design

1. Individual ability test
2. Make Decisions about Willingness to Contribute Ideas to the Group
3. Confidence Elicitation
4. Decide whether to agree with group answers

## Part 1: Measure individual ability
- Evaluate ability in six categories 
    + Arts and Literature 
    + Entertainment and Pop Culture 
    + Environmental Science 
    + History 
    + Geography 
    + Sports and Games 

- 30 multiple-choice questions, five in each category
- Forced Response: Participants had to answer every question
    + Why is this important?

## Part 2: Answering in groups

- Randomized into groups of two 
    + Partner is in lab but identify is unknown
    + Remain at indivudal computer terminals
- 30 **new** questions in same six categories
- For each question asked: 
    + What’s the answer? 
    + How willing are you to have your answer count as group answer?

- Groups earn points based upon the group answers 

## Part 2: Answering in groups

- Willingness to answer for group measured on 1-4 scale representing "place in line"
    + 1 is first in line, 4 is last in line
    + Member who stands closest to front of line will answer for the group
    + If both members stand in the same place, computer randomly chooses one to answer

- Notice that that although there are two members in each group, their willingness is measure on a 1-4 scale. Why?

## Part 3: Confidence
- Asked to estimate probability of: 
    + own answer being correct 
    + partner’s answer being correct
- Allows us to test for role of confidence in predicting willingness to contribute
    + Both confidence in self and confidence in a randomly drawn partner

## Part 4: Decide whether to agree with group answers
- All participants receive packet of group answers
- For each question, shows which member answered and which answer was chosen (based on "place in line")
- Participants face same 30 questions again with new opportunity to earn points
    + Can submit the same answers as group answers or new answers
- Different paper

## Treatments

2x2 design that varies on following dimensions:
    
1. How public is the contribution?
    + Private treatment: participants never learn partners identity
2. Do you receive feedback about relative ability?
    + No Feedback: receive no feedback on performance from AbilityTests
    + Feedback: after Part 1 Ability test, told the categories for which they had the highest Part 1 score in group
    
## Procedure
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("katie_procedure.png")
```

## Perceptions of categories
- At end, participants asked to rate each category according to which gender, on average, knows more about the category
- Options: Men know more (+1), women know more (-1), or no gender difference (0)

## "Gender" of Categories
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("katie_categories.png")
```

## Female willingness to contribute (relative to men)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("control_confidence.png")
```

## Missed opportunities by category

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("missed_opportunities.png")
```

## Summary of results

1. Willingness to contribute depends on the gender stereotype of the category
2. These patterns are partly explained by beliefs
3. The gender gaps in willingness to contribute have negative consequences for group performance
4. Providing feedback to talented individuals about their strengths does not significantly increase the probability that they contribute to the group

## Role Models in India (Beaman et al)

- Since 1993, India has adopted gender quotas for elected positions on village councils
- Fraction of elected local leaders who are female has risen from under 5\% in 1992 to over 40\% by 2000
- In West Bengal, one-third of village councils are randomly selected to be reserved for a woman chief councilor
- Beaman et al studied the effect of having women leaders on parents' aspirations for their children and on the childrens' own aspiration

## Aspiration questions
- If the parent would like the child to graduate from secondary school (grade 12)
- If the parent wishes the child to marry at an age above 18
- If the preferred occupation is different than housewife or what the in-laws
prefer
