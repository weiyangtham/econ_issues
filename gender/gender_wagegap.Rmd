## Roadmap

- What do economists mean by discrimination?
- What's driving the gender wage gap?

## Defining discrimination

$$ Y_i = X_i\beta + \alpha \textbf{1}(i = Female) + \epsilon_i $$ 
- $Y_i$ is wages; $X_i$ is a vector of ALL productivity characteristics
- $\textbf{1}(i = Female)$ indicates gender
- We have discrimination if $\alpha$ is negative; i.e. a female worker is paid less than an *otherwise identical* male worker

## Types of discrimination
- Taste-based discrimination
- Statistical discrimination

## Taste-based discrimination (Becker 1957)
- Employer dislikes members of a certain group for non-productivity related reasons
- They are willing to pay more for less productive workers
- In theory, the existence of discriminatory employers does not necessarily mean that a gender wage gap will prevail
    + Why?
    
## Statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain 1977)
- Employers perceive there to be differences in productivity across groups (e.g. men are better programmers)
- Gender may serve as a *signal* for productivity if employers cannot perfectly observe productivity
- Difficult to test because we have to know how employers form expectations

## Empirical evidence
- Gender cannot be randomly assigned
- Two studies that try to get around this
    + Goldin and Rouse (2001) study of orchestras
    + Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) audit study
    
## Blind Auditions
- In 1970s and 1980s, orchestras started using "blind" auditions to combat the gender disparity 
- In a blind audition, performance is done behind a screen to hide the performer's identity
- Goldin and Rouse look at whether a blind audition increases a woman's chance of being hired by an orchestra

## Method
- Suppose the study found that women in a blind audition tended to fare better than women in a non-blind audition. Why might this not be proof of discrimination?
    + The type of people who are chosen for blind auditions may be different
- Suppose women who are in both blind and non-blind auditions tend to do better in blind auditions. Why might this not be proof of discrimination?
    + People might perform better in blind auditions in general
- Use men as a control group (this is a difference-in-differences estimation strategy)

## Results
- Women are 50\% more likely to advance from preliminary rounds when there is a blind audition
- Results seem to indicate some form of discrimination
    + Cannot distinguish between statistical discrimination and taste-based discrimination
- Alternative explanation: women perform better in blind auditions when there is no expectation of discrimination (stereotype threat)

## Audit study (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2003)
- "Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?"
- Field experiment: Send out resumes with "white-sounding" and "black-sounding" names
- White-sounding names are more likely to receive callbacks

## What's in a name?
- Data Colada, [post 51](http://datacolada.org/51) and [post 36](http://datacolada.org/36)
- Idea of the experiment: use the name to convey information about race
- Question: could names be conveying information other than race?
- May be why Deming et al (2016) fail to replicate Bertrand and Mullainathan's results

## What's in a name?

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("greg-jamal.png")
```

## Names reflect socioeconomic status (SES)

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("compare_names_ses.png")
```

## Black names with different SES
```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("compare_names_race.png")
```

## Takeaway
- Using names is tricky, may contain information other than race
- Still suggests there's discrimination on some dimension, just maybe not all about race
- Comparison of names across different studies also tentative as studies may differ across multiple dimensions
    + Would be most helpful to take into account these factors *within a single study*

## A Grand Gender Convergence (Goldin 2014)

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("gender_wagegap_historic.jpg")
```

## Gender wage gap has been narrowing
- From "59 cents on the dollar" in the 1970s to "77 cents on the dollar" today

## Gender gaps by occupation
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("gap_by_occupation.png")
```

## Gender gaps by occupation
- Size of the gap varies widely by occupation
- Smaller in Science and Tech relative to Business
- What is Goldin's explanation for the different gaps across occupations?

## Pharmacists v.s. Lawyers
- Pharmacists have more flexible hours than lawyers 
- Pharmacists can substitute for each other more easily
    + Due to a combination of computerization, reduction in self-employment/growth in large chains
- Lawyers have increasing rewards to working more (non-linear returns to hours worked), while pharmacists have linear returns to hours worked

## Nonlinear returns for lawyers
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("nonlinear_law.png")
```

## Group Discussion
- In groups of 3-4, discuss whether you think it is possible to close the gender wage gap in occupations like law. How?

## Takeaways
- Economists's definition of discrimination
- How is this different from Goldin's explanation for the wage gap?
