## Gender wage gap has narrowed over time

## Roadmap

- What do economists mean by discrimination?
- Why has the wage gap narrowed?
- What's driving the gender wage gap?

## Defining discrimination

$$ Y_i = X_i\beta + \alpha \textbf{1}(i = Female) + \epsilon_i $$ 
- $Y_i$ is wages; $X_i$ is a vector of ALL productivity characteristics
- $\textbf{1}(i = Female)$ indicates gender
- We have discrimination if $\alpha$ is negative; i.e. a female worker is paid less than an *otherwise identical* male worker

## Types of discrimination
- Taste-based discrimination
- Statistical discrimination

## Taste-based discrimination (Becker 1957)
- Employer dislikes members of a certain group for non-productivity related reasons
- They are willing to pay more for less productive workers
- In theory, the existence of discriminatory employers does not necessarily mean that a gender wage gap will prevail
    + Why?
    
## Statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain 1977)
- Employers perceive there to be differences in productivity across groups (e.g. men are better programmers)
- Gender may serve as a *signal* for productivity if employers cannot perfectly observe productivity
- Difficult to test because we have to know how employers form expectations

## Empirical evidence
- Gender cannot be randomly assigned
- Two studies that try to get around this
    + Goldin and Rouse (2001) study of orchestras
    + Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) audit study
    
## Blind Auditions
- In 1970s and 1980s, orchestras started using "blind" auditions to combat the gender disparity 
- In a blind audition, performance is done behind a screen to hide the performer's identity
- Goldin and Rouse look at whether a blind audition increases a woman's chance of being hired by an orchestra

## Method
- Suppose the study found that women in a blind audition tended to fare better than women in a non-blind audition. Why might this not be proof of discrimination?
    + The type of people who are chosen for blind auditions may be different
- Suppose women who are in both blind and non-blind auditions tend to do better in blind auditions. Why might this not be proof of discrimination?
    + People might perform better in blind auditions in general
- Use men as a control group (this is a difference-in-differences estimation strategy)

## Results
