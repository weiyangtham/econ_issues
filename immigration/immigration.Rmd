## Questions of interest
- Is immigration beneficial to immigrants?
- Is immigration harmful to natives? We will focus mainly on this

## What does economic theory predict?
- Depends on whether immigrant labor is substitute or complement to native labor
- Will also depend on general equilibrium effects e.g. immigrants will also generate more demand for goods and services

## Mariel Boatlift (Card)
- Context: In 1980, the Cuban economy was in recession and many Cubans began to agitating to leave the country. Previously it was very difficult to leave the country
- In April 1980, Fidel Castro opened the port of Mariel, so that anyone who wanted to leave could do so. 
- From May to September 1980, 125 000 Cubans departed for Miami, FL, from Mariel. This led to a 7% increase in Miami's labor supply

## Research design
