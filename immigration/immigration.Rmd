## Survey



## Immigrants as Share of Total U.S. Population
```{r, fig.align='default'}
library(tidyverse)
us_immig = read_csv("us_immigration_1850_2015.csv")

ggplot(us_immig, aes(year, pct_immigrants)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  labs(y = "Immigrants as percentage of total U.S. population") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 24)

```
  
## Increase in share of Hispanics and Asians

## Educational attainment of immigrants has increased

```

## Questions of interest
- Is immigration beneficial to immigrants?
- Is immigration harmful to natives? We will focus mainly on this

## What does economic theory predict?
- Depends on whether immigrant labor is substitute or complement to native labor
- Will also depend on general equilibrium effects e.g. immigrants will also generate more demand for goods and services

## Mariel Boatlift (Card)
- Context: In 1980, the Cuban economy was in recession and many Cubans began to agitating to leave the country. Previously it was very difficult to leave the country
- In April 1980, Fidel Castro opened the port of Mariel, so that anyone who wanted to leave could do so. 
- From May to September 1980, 125 000 Cubans departed for Miami, FL, from Mariel. This led to a 7% increase in Miami's labor supply

## Research design
- Card selects Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tampa-St. Petersburg as control cities
- His "algorithm" for selecting those cities: they had relatively large black and hispanic populations, and showed similar economic growth to Miami over late 70s and early 80s.  

## Results
- Card finds no evidence that the influx of Cuban immigrants did not decrease wages or increase unemployment rates of low-skilled workers

## Challenges to Mariel Boatlift result
- "Mariel Boatlift that did not happen" (Angrist and Krueger 1999)
- "The Wage Impact of the Marielitos: A Reappraisal" (Borjas 2015)  

## Mariel Boatlift that did not happen
- In the summer of 1994, a similar boatlift was due to happen
- But an intervention by the Clinton administration diverted the "immigrants" to Guantanamo Bay
- Angrist and Krueger do a similar analysis and find that the "boat lift" raised the black unemployment rate in Miami
- Lesson: natural experiments can be imperfect

## Borjas Reappraisal 
- Main contention centers around the question: Who are the Miami workers most likely to be affected by the influx of immigrants? I.e. what is the treatment group?
- Example: Card includes female workers, but Borjas does not
- Borjas contention is that female participation in the labor force was changing rapidly **and** differently across cities

## Borjas Reappraisal: Sample size very small

```

## What Card doesn't tell us
- Suppose Card's result from the Mariel boatlift paper is reliable. It doesn't really tell us why natives' labor market outcomes were not hurt
- Next paper by Clemens, Lewis, Postel goes into how firms respond when immigration policy is more restrictive

## Bracero exclusion: context
- From 1942 to 1964, bilateral agreements facilitated the flow of temporary low-skill labor from Mexico to the U.S.
- Post-WW 2, the program became almost entirely focused on agriculture and supplied half a million seasonal workers to U.S. farms each year 
- The *bracero* program ended effective 1965, based on the argument that it hurt native workers economically

## Research design
- Compare states more dependent on *braceros* to states less dependent on *braceros*

## No improvement in wages
```{r, fig.align='center'}

```

## No improvement in wages
- One possible explanation is that farms adopted mechanization (if the technology was available)

## Farms increased mechanization

```

## The "Place Premium"

- Policy discussion focuses mostly on natives - how about immigrants themselves?
- The exact same worker would earn more in the U.S. than Haiti
- How much more?

## Clemens, Montenegro, Pritchett (CMP)

- First, CMP estimate the wage ratio between observably identical workers at home and abroad. Why might this overstate the wage premium?
- Try to estimate how much this is overstated by

## "True" wage premium

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("placepremium.png")
```

## How much of this is due to policy restrictions on immigration?
- CMP estimate wage ratios between places without policy restrictions on movement 
- Historically, highest ratio found is 1.8; more recently about 1.5
- Much lower than most of the wage ratios found in the previous figure
