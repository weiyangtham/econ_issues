## Questions of interest
- Is immigration beneficial to immigrants?
- Is immigration harmful to natives? We will focus mainly on this

## What does economic theory predict?
- Depends on whether immigrant labor is substitute or complement to native labor
- Will also depend on general equilibrium effects e.g. immigrants will also generate more demand for goods and services

## Mariel Boatlift (Card)
- Context: In 1980, the Cuban economy was in recession and many Cubans began to agitating to leave the country. Previously it was very difficult to leave the country
- In April 1980, Fidel Castro opened the port of Mariel, so that anyone who wanted to leave could do so. 
- From May to September 1980, 125 000 Cubans departed for Miami, FL, from Mariel. This led to a 7% increase in Miami's labor supply

## Research design
- Card selects Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tampa-St. Petersburg as control cities
- His "algorithm" for selecting those cities: they had relatively large black and hispanic populations, and showed similar economic growth to Miami over late 70s and early 80s.  

## Results
- Card finds no evidence that the influx of Cuban immigrants had a negative effect on Miami workers

## Challenges to Mariel Boatlift result
- "Mariel Boatlift that did not happen" (Angrist and Krueger 1999)
- "The Wage Impact of the Marielitos: A Reappraisal" Borjas 2015

## Mariel Boatlift that did not happen
- In the summer of 1994, a similar boatlift was due to happen but for an intervention by the Clinton administration that diverted the "immigrants" to Guantanamo Bay
- Angrist and Krueger do a similar analysis and find that the "boat lift" raised the black unemployment rate in Miami
- Lesson: natural experiments can be imperfect

## Borjas Reappraisal 
- Main (but not only!) contention centers around the question: Who are the Miami workers most likely to be affected by the influx of immigrants? I.e. what is the treatment group?
- Example: Card includes female workers, but Borjas does not
- Borjas contention is that female participation in the labor force was changing rapidly **and** differently across cities

## Borjas Reappraisal: Sample size very small

```

## What Card doesn't tell us
- Suppose Card's result from the Mariel boatlift paper is reliable. It doesn't really tell us why natives' labor market outcomes were not hurt
- Next paper by Clemens, Lewis, Postel goes into how firms respond when immigration policy is more restrictive
