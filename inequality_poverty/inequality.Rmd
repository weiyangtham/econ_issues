## Areas for improvement

- Using evidence to support argument 
- Choice of sources
- Editing

## Improve this argument
- What would you add to the following argument to **improve** it? Not looking for a counter-argument
- "10\% of the labor force in city X work in minimum wage jobs, therefore raising the minimum wage would increase their income."

## Things that are missing

"50\% of the labor force in city X work in minimum wage jobs, therefore raising the minimum wage would increase the incomes of many workers."

1. Empirical evidence: 
    + "Tham (2017) finds that a recent minimum wage increase in city Y led to an increase in earnings."
    
2. Assessing strength of evidence:
    + "This study is particularly relevant to city X because X and Y have similar demographics and slow-growing economies."

## Putting it together
"Although most studies of the minimum wage show a zero or small employment effect (Schmitt 2013), the unusual composition of city X's labor force and its slow-growing economy mean that many of those studies might not be applicable. However, recent evidence suggests that even cities like X can benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. Tham (2017) finds that a recent minimum wage increase in city Y led to an increase in earnings. This study is particularly relevant to city X because they have similar demographics and slow-growing economies. Since 50\% of the labor force in city X work in minimum wage jobs, raising the minimum wage would increase the incomes of many workers."

## Improve this argument
- What if modified the argument: "Although most studies...raising the minimum wage would increase the incomes of many workers **and improve their health outcomes.**"
- What is missing from this argument?
- Can't assume that health will improve! 

## A few types of evidence

- Direct empirical evidence (minimum wage caused better health)
- Indirect empirical evidence (higher incomes causes better health; higher incomes lead to better diet)
- Theoretically possible (higher incomes *could* lead families to use more healthcare services)

## Economic models
- Don't just list models, distinguish between them!
    + E.g. "Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010) find that increases in the minimum wage lead to a reduction in turnover, which suggests the dynamic monopsony model is a better characterization of the low-skilled labor market than the competitive model."
    
- Models are not evidence; there are no **laws** in economics e.g. "the law of demand says that raising the minimum wage will result in job losses"
    + Prove it! Use empirical evidence to say why your model is better than the other ones

## Sources
- Blogposts and newspaper articles are great ways to find interesting arguments and research papers 
- But they are often speculative (this is a feature, not a bug!) and they are not research papers - avoid relying on them directly as evidence
- Not all research papers are created equal; read the abstract or intro and at least figure out if they are theoretical or empirical, then whether the results are causal or correlational
    + Tip: Save time by finding articles/blogs that explain the research paper
- Don't just cite someone's opinion e.g. "The minimum wage is the most effective tool for reducing poverty. In fact, according to Tham (2018), the best way to fight poverty is to increase the minimum wage." 

## Direct quotes and plagiarism
- **Paraphrase!**
    + Makes your writing clearer and smoother
- If you lift text directly from an essay, use direct quotes
    + Lifting text without quotes is plagiarism!

# Inequality

## 

## David Autor video

1. O-ring principle (human genius and creativity) determines type of work
2. Never-get-enough principle (human insatiability/greed) determines how many jobs there actually are

## Types of inequality
- Income 
- Wealth 
- Others: consumption, health, wage

## Income v.s. Wealth

- Income is a flow
- Income is composed of labor income (e.g. wages, salaries) and capital income (e.g. rent, dividends, interest)
- Wealth is a stock
- Comes from wealth appropriated or accumulated in the past
- Wealth is the sum of assets minus financial liabilities (debt)

## Pair Discussion
- In pairs, discuss the following:

Should we care about income inequality? Come up with some reasons why or why not

<!--
if bottom improving slower than top, still improving
political power
fairness
poverty (we might even care abou relative poverty)
-->

```

## Changes in 90/10 ratio 
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("90_10_international.png")
```

## Takeaways
- Inequality has been rising since around the 80s
- Popular press focuses on the top 1\% but inequality in "the other 99\%" has also increased
    + We will focus on the latter
- Rising faster in the US than in other countries
- Why?

## Suggested explanations
- Skill-biased technological change/increase in the skill premium
- Decline of unions
- Trade (with China)

## College-High school earnings gap has doubled
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("college_premium_us.png")
```

## "Education Race" model
- Race between skill supply and skill demand
- The "skill premium" increases if demand outpaces supply
    + Education $\neq$ skill, but education easier to measure

## Question
- In the video, David Autor discusses a major event in the early 1900s increased skill supply. What was it?
    + High school movement

## Changes in skill supply over time
- In 1940, only 6\% of Americans had a 4-year college degree
- From end of WW2 to early 1980s, college enrollment grew rapidly 
- After 1982, share of college graduates continued to grow but at a slower rate

## Changes in skill supply over time
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("collegesharehours.png")
```

## Is the model consistent with the data?
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("autormodel.png")
```

## How useful is the model?
- Other studies also find that a simple demand-supply model has substantial explantory power for the change in the college-high school earnings gap (e.g. Katz and Murphy 1992)
- Does it matter for inequality? 
- Goldin and Katz (2010) estimate that the increase in the education wage premium explains 60-70\% of the rise in US wage inequality from 1980 to 2005

## How technology affects skill demand
- Innovations and computerization led to increasing routinization of tasks
- Raises the value of workers who can perform abstract tasks that are difficult to routinize (at the moment!), but lowers the value of workers in routine-intensive jobs (e.g. assembly line)
- Low-skill jobs like cleaning are also difficult to routinize, leading to a "polarized" labor market

## Polarization
- Increase in college premium not just about higher earnings for college workers 
- Partly due to falling real earnings for non-college-educated workers, particularly males

## Wage polarization
```{r, out.width='325px'}
knitr::include_graphics("realwage_byeduc.png")
```

## Discussion
- Despite his concerns over polarization, David Autor is fairly optimistic that the U.S. will be able to weather this challenge. 

1. Why is he optimistic?
<!--
hasn't happened in the past
"just" need to increase skills
-->
2. Do you share his optimism? Why or why not?

## Will AI replace lawyers?

- [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/technology/lawyers-artificial-intelligence.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/technology/lawyers-artificial-intelligence.html)
- Ross is a program being used to do certain aspects of legal work

## How good is Ross?
- A lawyer took 10 hours to find a similar case to the one he was working on, while Ross did it almost instantly. 
- Ross can't do everything yet; still need humans to write memos
- But "the trouble is that technology makes more and more work routine."

## Evidence for doom and gloom
- Based on the tasks performed in jobs, Frey and Osborne (2013) predict that 47\% of total U.S. employment is at risk of automation in the next 20 years
- Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) estimate that one more robot per thousand workers reduces the
employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5
percent

## Question
- How would you expect labor productivity to change if robots really were taking over?

with ATM bank tellers have doubled
fraction of US adults in workforce is higher than in 1890 


O-ring principle (human genius and creativity) determines type of work
never-get-enough principle (human insatiability/greed) determines how many jobs there actually are

tellers per branch fell by third but number of branches increased 40% because cheaper to open new branches

bank tellers job scope changed - more like salespeople, introducing them to products

each job has multiple tasks

improvement in one link of the chain increases value of other links
as tools improve, increases importance of human expertise, judgment, creativity

new industries arise because ppl still want stuff

there are jobs but not good jobs

solution to tractors? compulsory high school education. (Q: is this applicable today?)
