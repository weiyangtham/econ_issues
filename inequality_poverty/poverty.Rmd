## Overview
- Much of the concern over inequality and the robot apocalypse is poverty-related
- The Universal Basic Income (UBI) is gaining a lot of attention, especially among Silicon Valley-types
- We will discuss this and other poverty reduction programs that have been tried and proposed

## Features of UBI
1. Unconditional (don't have to fulfill certain requirements, like sending child to school)
2. Not means-tested (income does not have to below a threshold to qualify)
3. Long term
4. Covers basic living expenses
5. Distributed to everyone within a set region

## Main concerns about UBI
- Cause people to work less
    + Hurts economy
    + People derive meaning from work
- Too expensive

## Negative Income Tax (NIT) experiments 
- Carried out in the 70s to reduce disincentive to work
- In other programs, benefits are completely gone when income rises above a threshold, creating a disincentive to work
- Hope was to lessen this disincentive with the negative income tax
- Federal government authorized randomized control trials to study NIT at multiple locations over 3-5 years

## What is a negative income tax?

1. Maximum cash transfer benefit
2. Benefit reduced for each dollar of earned income (or an implicit tax)

## NIT experiments v.s. UBI
1. Unconditional (don't have to fulfill certain requirements, like sending child to school)
2. Not means-tested (income does not have to below a threshold to qualify)
3. ~~Long term~~
4. Covers basic living expenses
5. ~~Distributed to everyone within a set region~~

## NIT in an economic model

## Effect of NIT on labor supply

- Generally find small on labor supply
- One of the experiments found a 4\% reduction in employment, but turned out to be the result of misreporting
    + NIT recipients underreported earnings to get higher benefits
 
## Limitations of NIT experiments
- Data collection issues
- Short-term 
- Cannot assess macro effects

## Alaska Permanent Fund
- Money from oil royalties invested in a sovereign wealth fund
- Fund pays yearly dividends to Alaska residents
- Amount paid out depends on fund's performance

## Alaska Permanent Fund
- Number of recipients: 660 000 individuals
- Amount: \$1000 to \$2000 in recent years
- Duration: 1982 to present

## Alaska Permanent Fund v.s. UBI
1. Unconditional (don't have to fulfill certain requirements, like sending child to school)
2. Not means-tested (income does not have to below a threshold to qualify)
3. Long term
4. ~~Covers basic living expenses~~
5. Distributed to everyone within a set region

## Question
- Assume for the moment that when an average Alaska resident receives a dividend *but no one else does*, they reduce their labor supply ("partial equilibrium" effect)
- In the real-life scenario where all Alaska residents receive a dividend, the same resident might actually no longer reduce their labor supply, or reduce it by a smaller amount. Why?

<!-- macro effects; 
lower labor supply leads to higher equilibrium wage 
more demand, more labor demand? esp if ppl spend money at the same time
-->

## Employment effects of Alaska Permanent Fund
- Using synthetic control method, Jones and Marinescu (2017) study effect of Alaska Permanent Fund
- Employment-to-population ratio of Alaska doesn't change relative to control states
- Share of Alaskans who work in part-time jobs increased by 2 percentage points
- People remained employed, but worked fewer hours

## Lottery winners
-  

## Lottery winners v.s. UBI
1. Unconditional 
2. Not means-tested 
3. Long term (depends on how winnings are distributed)
4. Covers basic living expenses (for big lottery)
5. ~~Distributed to everyone within a set region~~

## What will be the effects of UBI?
- In 1970s,
