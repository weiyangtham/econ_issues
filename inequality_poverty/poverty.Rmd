## Overview
- Much of the concern over inequality and the robot apocalypse is poverty-related
- The Universal Basic Income (UBI) is gaining a lot of attention, especially among Silicon Valley-types
- We will discuss this and other poverty reduction programs that have been tried and proposed

## Features of UBI

1. Unconditional (don't have to fulfill certain requirements, like sending child to school)
2. Not means-tested (income does not have to below a threshold to qualify)
3. Long term
4. Covers basic living expenses
5. Distributed to everyone within a set region

## Main concerns about UBI
- Cause people to work less
    + Hurts economy
    + People derive meaning from work
- Macroeconomic effects like inflation
- Too expensive

## Negative Income Tax (NIT) experiments 

- Carried out in the 70s to reduce disincentive to work
- In other programs, benefits are completely gone when income rises above a threshold, creating a disincentive to work
- Hope was to lessen this disincentive with the negative income tax
- Federal government authorized randomized control trials to study NIT at multiple locations over 3-5 years

## What is a negative income tax?

1. Maximum cash transfer benefit
2. Benefit reduced for each dollar of earned income (or an implicit tax)

## NIT experiments v.s. UBI
1. Unconditional (don't have to fulfill certain requirements, like sending child to school)
2. Not means-tested (income does not have to below a threshold to qualify)
3. ~~Long term~~
4. Covers basic living expenses
5. ~~Distributed to everyone within a set region~~

## NIT in an economic model

```

## Effect of NIT on labor supply

- Generally find small on labor supply
- One of the experiments found a 4\% reduction in employment, but turned out to be the result of misreporting
    + NIT recipients underreported earnings to get higher benefits
 
## Limitations of NIT experiments
- Data collection issues
- Short-term 
- Cannot assess macro effects

## Alaska Permanent Fund
- Money from oil royalties invested in a sovereign wealth fund
- Fund pays yearly dividends to Alaska residents
- Amount paid out depends on fund's performance

## Alaska Permanent Fund
- Number of recipients: 660 000 individuals
- Amount: \$1000 to \$2000 in recent years
- Duration: 1982 to present

## Alaska Permanent Fund v.s. UBI
1. Unconditional (don't have to fulfill certain requirements, like sending child to school)
2. Not means-tested (income does not have to below a threshold to qualify)
3. Long term
4. ~~Covers basic living expenses~~
5. Distributed to everyone within a set region

## Question
- Assume for the moment that when an average Alaska resident receives a dividend *but no one else does*, they reduce their labor supply ("partial equilibrium" effect)
- In the real-life scenario where all Alaska residents receive a dividend, the same resident might actually no longer reduce their labor supply, or reduce it by a smaller amount. Why?

<!-- macro effects; 
lower labor supply leads to higher equilibrium wage 
more demand, more labor demand? esp if ppl spend money at the same time
-->

## Employment effects of Alaska Permanent Fund
- Using synthetic control method, Jones and Marinescu (2017) study effect of Alaska Permanent Fund
- Employment-to-population ratio of Alaska doesn't change relative to control states
- Share of Alaskans who work in part-time jobs increased by 2 percentage points
- People remained employed, but worked fewer hours

## Lottery winners

## Lottery winners - Sweden
- Cesarini et al (2015) compare winners to non-winners in the same lottery
- Some are lump sum payments, some are installments

## Lottery winners v.s. UBI
1. Unconditional 
2. Not means-tested 
3. Long term (depends on how winnings are distributed)
4. Covers basic living expenses (for big lottery)
5. ~~Distributed to everyone within a set region~~

## Results
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("cesarini_lottery.png")
```

## Findings
- Winning \$140 000 (\$1M kronor) decreased the probability of working by 2 percentage points, but within 10 years the effect was gone (i.e. people returned to work)
- Hours worked per week decreased by 1 to 1.5 hours per week
- Whether the payment was lump sum or in installments didn't matter

## Does UBI cause inflation?
- 

## Earned Income Tax Credit
- Can think of as a variation on the Negative Income Tax

discussion: based on the podcasts and the evidence on cash transfers in developing countries, do you think cash transfers are an effective policy for the US? Are you concerned about cases like the woman in the podcast who took her son to disneyland?
