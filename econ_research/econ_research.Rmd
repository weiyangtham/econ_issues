## Reading

- Noah Smith suggests three strategies for evaluating evidence from economics research. What are they?

<div class="notes">
- Don't rely on a single paper
- Look at the methods of the paper; are the assumptions realistic?
- Meta-analyses

</div>

## Today's lecture

- Over the semester, we will often ask: What is the effect of X on Y?
- Goal of this lecture: learn how to evaluate economic research even when you are not an expert (Smith's second point)

<!--
## Example: effect of college education on earnings
- Does going to college lead to higher earnings?
- We can compare the average earnings of people who go to college with those who do not
- What is the problem with this?

## Do laptops help or hurt learning in the classroom?
- Discussion: Suppose we found that students who bring their laptops to class have higher/lower grades than students who do not. What would be the problem with using this result to claim that laptops help/hurt learning?

## Dealing with bias
- Confounders/unobservables are variables that we may not be able to observe in the data
- Confounding can lead us to overstate the effect of laptops on learning if they are correlated with both laptop use **and** learning (bias)
- The empirical economist's job is to (try to) eliminate this bias

## Tools of the trade
- Regression
- Randomized Control Trials (RCTs)
- Instrumental variables
- Difference-in-differences
- Regression Discontinuity

## Regression
- Statistical technique to "hold constant" things we can observe
- Statistical version of **ceteris paribus**
- Toy regression: 
$$ Earnings = \beta_1 * AttendedCollege + \beta_2 * FamilyIncome $$ 
- In words: for two persons with the same family income, what is the return to attending college?

## Regression
- Not enough on its own; there are always things we cannot observe

## Randomization: The "gold standard"
- Ensure that on average, laptop and "no laptop" students are the same
- Common terms: randomized control trials or RCTs, field experiments, lab experiments

## Example: lab experiment
- Lab experiment: Researchers had students watch a lecture and randomly assigned them to to take notes with either a laptop or pen and paper. They found that students who used laptops performed worse

# Example: field experiment
- Researchers randomly assigned sections of a class to one of three conditions:
    1. electronics allowed
    2. electronics banned, and 
    3. tablet computers allowed, but only if laid flat on desks
- Students did worse if laptops/tablets were allowed

## Can't always run experiments
- Expensive
- Unethical (e.g. effect of lead poisoning)

## The next best thing: natural experiments
- Other terms: quasi-random assignment, quasi-experiments
- Three main tools for studying natural experiments
    - Instrumental Variables
    - Difference-in-differences
    - Regression Discontinuity
    
## Instrumental Variables
- Sometimes known as "instruments"
- Remember that confounders are a problem because they may be related to both laptop use **and** grades
- An instrumental variable affects laptop use but not grades

## Example of instrumental variable


## Difference-in-differences
```{r, echo = FALSE}
dd = data_frame(
  effect = c("+ Effect", "+ Effect", "No Effect", "No Effect", "No Effect", "No Effect"), 
  treated = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), 
  y = c(2, 5, 2, 4, 0, 2), 
  x = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1))

ggplot(dd, aes(x, y, linetype = effect, colour = treated)) + geom_line() + 
  scale_linetype_discrete(guide = FALSE) + 
  econothemes::theme_nber()
```

## Regression Discontinuity
- Compare people who are on either side of an arbitrary cutoff 
- Example: if the cutoff to get a scholarship is an SAT score of 1400, we can estimate the effect of getting a scholarship by comparing someone who got 1399 and someone who got 1401.
