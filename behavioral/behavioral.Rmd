## Behavioral economics

- Using insights from other fields (especially psychology) to understand how people make economic decisions
- Understanding how people deviate systematically from rational behavior
    + Are people "predictably irrational"? And how?
- How does irrational behavior matter in the market? Does it cancel out on average? Are people more rational when the stakes are higher?

## [Behavioral economics and public policy](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20928)
- Advocates a "pragmatic" way of thinking about behavioral economics
- Rather than asking if the behavioral model or the rational model is right, focus on developing policy-oriented solutions (e.g. how do we get people to save more?)
- Reflects a shift in how economics is done today - less emphasis on finding a unifying model of human behavior, more emphasis on context-dependent solutions

## Examples

1. How much to save
2. How much to work
3. Where to live
