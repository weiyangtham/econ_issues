## Behavioral economics

- Using insights from other fields (especially psychology) to understand how people make economic decisions
- Understanding how people deviate systematically from rational behavior
    + Are people "predictably irrational"? And how?
- How does irrational behavior matter in the market? Does it cancel out on average? Are people more rational when the stakes are higher?

## Nudging and Libertarian Paternalism
- Small, relatively costless interventions
- Take into account cognitive biases
- Should not restrict choices

## [Behavioral economics and public policy](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20928)
- Advocates a "pragmatic" way of thinking about behavioral economics
- Rather than asking if the behavioral model or the rational model is right, focus on developing policy-oriented solutions (e.g. how do we get people to save more?)
- Reflects a shift in how economics is done today - less emphasis on finding a unifying model of human behavior, more emphasis on context-dependent solutions

## Examples

1. How much to save
2. Where to live

## "Save More Tomorrow" program
- Designed to get employees contribute more to retirement plans
- What is the rationale for each of the following features of the program?

1. Ask employees to sign up for a plan to increase contribution rates *at a later date*
2. Contribution rate increases after a raise
3. Contribution rates increase automatically for each raise until they reach a preset maximum
4. Can opt out of the plan at any time

## Rational for each feature
1. Ask employees to sign up for a plan to increase contribution rates *at a later date*
    + Helps to counter present bias (hyperbolic discounting)
2. Contribution rate increases after a raise
    + Minimize loss aversion
3. Contribution rates increase automatically for each raise until they reach a preset maximum
    + Take advantage of inertia/status quo bias
4. Can opt out of the plan at any time
    + Mainly ethical, and people probably feel more comfortable joining a program they can opt out of
    
## Question
- Suppose you find that people do increase their retirement contributions after enrolling in a program like "Save More Tomorrow". Does that necessarily mean that people are saving more?
- Could be saving less in non-retirement accounts

## [Active vs. Passive Decisions and Crowd-Out in Retirement Savings Accounts](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18565)
- Chetty et al (2014) look at the effect on the overall savings rate

## [Active vs. Passive Decisions and Crowd-Out in Retirement Savings Accounts](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18565)
- Compare two policies that try to change behavior through "active" or "passive" decisions
- Passive: increases in automatic contributions from employers
- Active: subsidies for an individual's contributions to their pension
- Conclusion: policies that raise retirement contributions if individuals don't need to take action much more effective than those that require individuals to make an active decision 

## Why?
- 1999 subsidy reduction for pension contributions for people in top income bracket
- How did individuals respond?

## Most people are passive savers

```

## Why don't people move to where their children would do better?
- "Rational" reasons
    + Stay close to family and friends
    + Place low weight on children's outcomes
- Behavioral reasons
    + Present bias: put too much weight on costs of moving now v.s. future benefits of growing up in a better neighborhood
    + Lack of information: don't realize benefits of being in a better neighborhood
    + Projection bias: don't accurately predict how future tastes will change e.g. over-estimate how much they will miss new friends, and don't sufficiently take into account making new friends
    + Limited bandwidth: living in poverty uses up mental resources for complex decisions or long-term thinking

## Rationale for government intervention
- Neoclassical model: should not intervene unless there are externalities
    + What are some externalities from having children grow up in better neighborhoods?
- Behavioral model:
    + Even if there are no externalities, can be optimal to incentivize moving to better neighborhoods
    + Government intervention can correct "internalities" 
    
<!-- 
Less crime
externalities from education
-->

## Difficulties

1. If actual choices are not the same as optimal choices, (even more) difficult to measure welfare

2. Family's decision not to move is consistent with both the neoclassical(rational) and behavioral models. That is, we are uncertain about which model is the right one. 
    + What does that imply for the type of policies we should adopt? Is government intervention justified? 

## Implications of model uncertainty
- Should try nudges
    + Relatively costless
    + Optimizers just won't change their behavior
- Subsidies (e.g. housing vouchers) are justifiable if we believe the behavioral model could be correct

## Final remarks
- Nudging isn't always good!

## Group Discussion
- You read about the replication crisis in psychology framed around Amy Cuddy and the power pose. How has this affected your perception of how scientific research is done? For example, has it made you more or less skeptical? The article is about the field of psychology, but how does your answer apply to the economics research we've looked at in this class?

## Replication crisis in psychology
- [Brian Nosek and the Reproducibility Project](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/)
- Replicated 100 psychology studies, were only able to replicate about one-third of the results
- Part of a broader movement in psychology questioning the reliability of earlier results

## [Why is replication important?](http://datacolada.org/53/)
- We want to use scientific results to make some prediction about the future
    + Sodium + water react to form sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas
    + More immigration will lead to a reduction in employment for natives

## Why don't studies replicate?
- Publication bias
- P-hacking - FiveThirtyEight [p-hacking tool](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1)
- Not the same as scientific fraud!

## How does behavioral economics compare?
- [Camerer et al](https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/eerp_sci_camerer_published_mainplussom_2016-1.pdf) replicated 18 studies published in two major economics journals from 2011 to 2014
- Replicated about two-thirds of the results (one-third for psychology)
    + These replication studies are not perfectly comparable, but still worth thinking about
- Possible explanation for differences (somewhat speculative!)
    + No deception in experimental econ
    + Better norms for transparency
    + More pressure to study interventions that would hold in "real world"

## How about empirical economics?
- [Star Wars: The Empirics Strike Back](http://ftp.iza.org/dp7268.pdf)
- Evidence that researchers are manipulating results to make results publishable

## Solutions
- Transparent sharing of data and methods
- Pre-analysis plans (tying your hands) - specify what you're going to do before embarking on a project
