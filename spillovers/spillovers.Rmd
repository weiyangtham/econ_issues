## Amazon HQ2

- Amazon announced last week that it is looking for a new location to build a second headquarters (HQ2) 
- Cities all over the U.S. (and Toronto) were immediately declaring their interest in this project 
- Why?

## Benefits of getting Amazon HQ2

- Direct benefits: Amazon is promising 50 000 jobs and a $5bn investment
- What indirect benefits can you think of?
    + increase in productive workers may make other other workers more productive
- How about costs?
    + tax benefits to attract Amazon
    + disruptions to local life

## Agglomeration economies: Why do cities exist? 

Another way of framing the question: what are the benefits of population density? A few hypotheses:

1. Reduced transport costs + economies of scale (Krugman); how about service industries?

<!-- access to bigger markets means more specialization, potentially higher returns, more diversity for consumers. e.g. think of restaurants -->

2. Firms and workers can look for each other more easily; this is also known as "labor market pooling" or "thick" labor markets. 
     + Can you think of another market where "thickness" is important?

3. Increase the flow of ideas; more opportunities to learn and for ideas to be combined i.e. human capital externalities
    + Has the internet meant the "death of distance"?

<!-- counter-example: Silicon Valley -->

## Policy questions

- If we think that there are benefits to agglomeration, does that mean that cities should try to attract more people (especially high-skilled people)?
- If yes, how?
- Is that beneficial from a macro perspective, or are we just shifting people around with no net gain?

## Greenstone, Hornbeck, Moretti (GHM)

- This might shed a little light on the "Amazon Question": what is the effect of successfully attracting a large new firm/plant?
- GHM focus on what the effect of opening a new plant is on the productivity of incumbent plants i.e. plants that were already at the winning location
- What is the problem with just comparing incumbent plants at the winning location with plants at any another location?
    + Firms are trying to maximize profits, not picking locations at random

<!-- potential unobservables: local transportation infrastructure, current and future costs of factors of production, quality of the workforce, presence of intermediate input suppliers, and any other local cost shifter. -->
 
## "Million Dollar Plants" strategy

- "Million Dollar Plants" is a regular feature in a real estate magazine that describes how a large plant decided where to locate
- The feature lists the winning county and runner-up counties
- GHM uses the incumbent plants in the runner-up counties as a control group for incumbent plants in the winning counties

## "Winning" plants became more productive

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("moretti_milliondollar_coefs.png")
```

## Why did winning plants become more productive?
- Spillover effects were largest between industries using similar technologies, or industries that workers are more likely to shift between
- This is indirect evidence that spillovers occur through the sharing of ideas, possibly through workers moving between firms

## Back to Amazon

- asdf

## Trying to see the unseen

- The "Million Dollar Plants" paper suggests that attracting a new plant and new workers can improve the productivity of other plants

- It would be nice if we could actually observe spillovers directly
    + e.g. actually observe people interacting and quantify how much of that interaction leads to sharing of knowledge
    
## Paul Krugman (1991)

> Knowledge flows are invisible; they leave no paper trail by which they may be measured and tracked...

## But there is hope!
- There are, in fact, ways that knowledge flows can leave paper trails
-
