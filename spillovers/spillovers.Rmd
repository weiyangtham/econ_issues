## Amazon HQ2

- Amazon announced last week that it is looking for a new location to build a second headquarters (HQ2) 
- Cities all over the U.S. (and Toronto) were immediately declaring their interest in this project 

## Group discussion
- Form groups of 3-4
- Imagine Columbus is bidding for Amazon's new headquarters. Discuss what the benefits for  Columbus would be if its bid was successful? What are the potential costs, and what can be done to mitigate them? Feel free to be make your discussion as specific to Columbus as you'd like.

<!--
## Benefits of getting Amazon HQ2

- Direct benefits: Amazon is promising 50 000 jobs and a $5bn investment
- What indirect benefits can you think of?
    + increase in productive workers may make other other workers more productive
- How about costs?
    + tax benefits to attract Amazon
    + disruptions to local life
-->

## Agglomeration economies: Why do cities exist? 

Another way of framing the question: what are the benefits of population density? A few hypotheses:

1. Reduced transport costs + economies of scale (Krugman); bigger markets allow firms to specialize
    + Example: "Chinese" restaurant v.s. Szechuan restaurant

<!-- access to bigger markets means more specialization, potentially higher returns, more diversity for consumers. e.g. think of restaurants -->

2. Firms and workers can look for each other more easily; this is also known as "labor market pooling" or "thick" labor markets. 
     + Can you think of another market where "thickness" is important?

3. Increase the flow of ideas; more opportunities to learn and for ideas to be combined 
    + Has the internet meant the "death of distance"?

<!-- counter-example: Silicon Valley -->

## Policy questions

- If we think that there are benefits to agglomeration, does that mean that cities should try to attract more people (especially high-skilled people)?
- If yes, how?
- Is that beneficial from a macro perspective, or are we just shifting people around with no net gain?

## Greenstone, Hornbeck, Moretti (GHM)

- This might shed a little light on the "Amazon Question": what is the effect of successfully attracting a large new firm/plant?
- GHM focus on what the effect of opening a new plant is on the productivity of incumbent plants i.e. plants that were already at the winning location
- What is the problem with just comparing incumbent plants at the winning location with plants at any another location?
    + Firms are trying to maximize profits, not picking locations at random

<!-- potential unobservables: local transportation infrastructure, current and future costs of factors of production, quality of the workforce, presence of intermediate input suppliers, and any other local cost shifter. -->
 
## "Million Dollar Plants" strategy

- "Million Dollar Plants" is a regular feature in a real estate magazine that describes how a large plant decided where to locate
- The feature lists the winning county and runner-up counties
- GHM uses the incumbent plants in the runner-up counties as a control group for incumbent plants in the winning counties

## "Winning" plants became more productive

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("moretti_milliondollar_coefs.png")
```

## Why did winning plants become more productive?
- Spillover effects were largest between industries using similar technologies, or industries that workers are more likely to shift between
- This is indirect evidence that spillovers occur through the sharing of ideas, possibly through workers moving between firms

## Trying to see the unseen

- The "Million Dollar Plants" paper suggests that attracting a new plant and new workers can improve the productivity of other plants

- It would be nice if we could actually observe spillovers directly
    + e.g. actually observe people interacting and quantify how much of that interaction leads to sharing of knowledge
    
## Paul Krugman (1991)

> Knowledge flows are invisible; they leave no paper trail by which they may be measured and tracked...

## But there is hope!
- There are, in fact, ways that knowledge flows can leave paper trails
- Patents
- Academic papers 

## Measurement is not the only problem
- Data on how people interact is hard to get
- Even if we get it, what would be the difficulty in estimating the *causal* effect of physical proximity on innovative activity?

## "Microgeography and the Direction of Inventive Activity" - Catalini (2017)

- Setting: Paris Jussieu, leading research campus in France
- Fun quote from Wikipedia: 

> "The campus is generally decried as an architectural failure...Sound-proofing is very poor, with classes regularly having to briefly stop when someones flushes the toilet next door." 

- From 1997 to 2014, labs on the campus had to be relocated as part of an asbestos removal process
- Because of urgency and complexity of the operation, labs did not have much say in the relocation process (i.e. labs more likely to be randomly colocated)

## Catalini (2017)

- Catalini makes use of this quasi-experiment to estimate the effect of colocation on collaboration between labs
- Colocation increases the rate of collaboration (coauthoring papers) by 3.5 times
- Besides the quantity of collaboration, how else could physical proximity affect the type of research produced?
    + Combining different fields of knowledge
    + More opportunities to iterate on ideas, but also less costly to pursue low-quality projects

## Additional findings
- Labs produced more similar research after colocation (excluding joint collaborations)
- New collaborations were more likely to be of high- or low-quality (i.e. upper or lower ends of distribution)

## Conclusion
- Physical proximity made labs more aware of each others' work and made it easier to pursue joint projects

## Has the internet made distance irrelevant?
- Another way to put it: Has communication technology been a substitute or complement to physical proximity? What do you think?

## Bitnet
- An early version of the internet in the 1980s
- Used by academics for computer-based communications
- Researchers could not only communicate over Bitnet, but could also share data
- Bitnet did not have features like the World Wide Web and browsers

## Agrawal and Goldfarb (2008)
- Study the effect of Bitnet on collaboration between (electrical engineering) researchers at universities that adopted Bitnet

## Bitnet increased collaboration
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bitnet_increased_collab.png")
```

## Who benefitted?
- Increase in collaboration was greatest for pairs of universities where one was top-tier and the other was mid-tier, *and* were colocated
    + e.g. MIT–Northeastern University in Boston/Cambridge University of Pennsylvania–Drexel University in Philadelphia
- Mid-tier universities seemed to "benefit" the most in terms of producing more publications

## Implications
- In these circumstances, communication technology turned out to have the strongest impact as a complement to face-to-face interactions
    + Doesn't mean it can't be a substitute! Just not the main effect
- Lower costs of collaboration led to greater specialization - researchers at top-tier universities and mid-tier universities likely to have different strengths and resources available to them

## Place-based policies

- Much of what we've seen suggests that "place-based policies" could have an important role to play in economic development
- Many government programs are "person-based" e.g. welfare, while place-based policies target a geographic area with things like subsidies, investments, or special rules and regulations

## Examples of place-based policies
- "Big push" policies: large investments in a region e.g. Tennessee Valley Authority
    + Little "big push": getting firms to move headquarters or plants to a city
- Empowerment zones: a combination of tax incentives for firms and investment funds for local authorities for the neediest urban and rural areas in the U.S.

## Tennessee Valley Authority
- TVA was created by Congress in 1933 to modernize the Tennessee Valley economy
- Total federal investment of \$20bn dollars between 1934 and 2000
- Bulk of investment occurred over 1940 to 1958
- Funds went into public infrastructure including roads, dams, and a 650-mile navigation canal

## Was the TVA effective?

- Kline and Moretti (2013) compared outcomes in the Tennessee Valley to other regions where similar authorities were considered, but eventually failed to be formed
- The TVA was effective in generating manufacturing jobs and shifted the region from a low-productivity sector (agriculture) to a high-productivity sector (manufacturing) 
- Average wages in the region did not increase as workers moved into the region to match the increase in demand
- However, Kline and Moretti also find that there was no net gain to the economy at a national level

## Discussion
- What other problems might there be with "big push" policies?

## Question
- 

<!-- 
- mayors might bid too much
- government has to act like a venture capitalist. many tech clusters were not the result of deliberate government policy
-->

## Empowerment zones

- In 1993, Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded Empowerment Zones (EZs) to local communities via a competitive application process
- Firms were given tax incentives to hire workers who  lived and worked in the community (wage subsidy)
- EZs were also given block grants to invest in infrastructure, training programs 
- These incentives were administered from 1994 to 2000
- Impoverished neighborhoods in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Cleveland were awarded EZ status

## Did EZs work?
- Busso et al (2013) compare communities that won to communities that lost
- They find that employment and wgaes increased in EZs
- Population and housing rents in the EZs remained stable, so gains in employment and wages were not cancelled out by increases in the cost of living

## Why did EZs work?
- Other residents in the same city may not want to move into the poorest neighborhoods, at least in the short term
- Over the longer-term, more people may be willing to move into those neighborhoods and increase rents






<!-- separation does not negatively affect collaboration between previously colocated labs -->

## Background on patent citations

- A patent contains citations (sometimes called "references")
- If patent Y cites patent X, that means that patent Y built on a piece of knowledge from X
- The patent applicant is legally obliged to cite knowledge that she has built on
- The patent examiner, who is supposed to be an expert in the patent's technological area, identifies citations the applicant may have missed out

## Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson

- "Geographic Localization of Knowledge Spillovers as Evidenced by Patent Citations"
- Citations are two to six times more likely to come from the same city as the citing patent
- Still doesn't tell us exactly why, but we're getting closer!
