## Overview

- Over the semester, we will often ask: What is the effect of X on Y?
- Goal of this class: learn how to evaluate economic research even when you are not an expert

## Reading

- Smith suggests three strategies for evaluating evidence from economics research. What are they?

## Example: effect of college education on earnings
- Does going to college lead to higher earnings?
- We can compare the average earnings of people who go to college with those who do not
- What is the problem with this?

## Correlation and causation

## Correlation and causation
- People who go to college and those who don't are likely to differ in substantial ways that can influence their decision to attend college **and** their future earnings
- If not accounted for, these differences can bias our results
- The empirical economist's job is to (try to) eliminate this bias

## Tools of the trade
- Regression
- Randomized Control Trials (RCTs)
- Instrumental variables
- Difference-in-differences
- Regression Discontinuity

## Caveat about tools
- These tools are used in a substantial portion, but not all, of economics research
