Learning objectives: 

Role of basic science in economic growth
economic rationale for public funding of science
how economics can be used to understand institutions and incentives in science - talk about doubling

podcast themes: much of it goes to university overhead; 10% chance of getting grant; what is the rate of return on science?

-->

## Today

- Why do we think science and basic research are important?
- What is the economic justification for government funding of science?
- How do current scientific institutions incentive (or disincentivize) scientific discovery?

## Basic research is largely funded by the government

```

## Discussion
- 

## Context
- For much of today's lecture, we will look at science policy through the lens of biomedical research
- The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the main source of government spending on biomedical research, is also the largest federal agency by R&D spending

## The Endless Frontier
- some history of US science?

## NIH Background
- NIH budget is over \$30 billion

## NIH funding has stagnated
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 22))

nihfunding = read_tsv("nih_fundingfacts.tsv", col_types = cols(Statistic = 'd')) 
nihfunding %<>% select(-Source) %>% 
  rename(ic = IC, fiscalyear = `Fiscal Year`, topic = Topic, mechanism = Mechanism, activity = Activity, 
       type = Type, statistic = Statistic)

nihfunding %<>% spread(topic, statistic) %>% 
  rename(totalfunding = `Awards - Funding (Total Cost)`, meanfunding = `Awards - Average Total Cost`, 
         n_awards = `Awards - Number`, success_rate = `Success Rate`, 
         n_applications = `Applications - Number`)

brdpi = read_tsv('brdpi.tsv')
# Base year 1998
brdpi %<>% mutate(brdpi98 = max(if_else(fiscalyear == 1998, brdpi, NA_real_), na.rm = T), 
                  brdpi = brdpi/brdpi98)

nihfunding %>% 
  left_join(brdpi, by = 'fiscalyear') %>% 
  filter(ic == "All NIH", mechanism == 'Research Grants', activity == 'R01', 
         type == 'All Types (in aggregate)')  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fiscalyear, totalfunding/brdpi/1e9)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + geom_point(size = 3) +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2003, linetype = 2) +
  geom_label(data = data_frame(fiscalyear = 2005.3, y = 6.5, text = "Doubling Ends"), 
            aes(x = fiscalyear, y = y, label = text), size = 4.5, fill = 'darkred', color = 'white') +
  labs(title = "Total funding for R01 grants", 
       subtitle = "Deflated by Biomedical R&D Price Index (Base Year 1998)", 
       y = "$ Billion", x = "Fiscal Year") 

```

## Success rates (chances of getting a grant) have fallen drastically
```{r}
nihfunding %>% 
  filter(ic == "All NIH", mechanism == 'Research Grants', activity == 'R01', 
         type == 'All Types (in aggregate)')  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fiscalyear, success_rate*100)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + geom_point(size = 3) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2003, linetype = 2) + 
  geom_label(data = data_frame(fiscalyear = 2005.3, success_rate = 0.3, text = "Doubling Ends"), 
            aes(label = text), size = 4.5, fill = 'darkred', color = 'white') + 
  labs(x = "Fiscal Year", y = "Percentage points")
```
