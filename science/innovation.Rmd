Productivity growth is central to economic growth and improvements in living standards. Note that consistent economic growth has been a feature of human societies only relatively recently (show graph going back to industrial revolution). Innovation is an important channel for getting productivity growth - inventions, advances in knowledge. 

## Knowledge as a public good
- Definition of public good: non-rivalrous and non-excludable
    - Use by one person does not diminish the amount available to others
    - Cannot exclude others from using it
- new knowledge generates positive externalities. Other people can build on new knowledge that inventor/scientist may not come up with on their own. Individual inventors may not be able to bear risk. 
- If left entirely to private sector, science would be under-produced
- In the US, government support is a huge source of funding for basic science e.g. ~$30bn in biomedical research from NIH. 

We will look at how the tools of modern empirical microeconomics, many of which we have seen used in earlier topics, have been applied to better understand the "knowledge production function".
