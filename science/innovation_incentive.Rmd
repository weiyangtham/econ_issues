## Intro
- As discussed before, knowledge has the properties of a public good (not depleted when consumed and non-excludable)
- This suggests that markets will under-provide
- Today we will discuss different incentive systems that have emerged to overcome this problem

## Incentive systems
- Priority (or "Priority of discovery")
- Prizes/Contests
- Patents
- Copyrights

## Priority 
- Being the first to communicate an advance in knowledge
- The reward or payoff is the *recognition* of being first

## Forms of Recognition
- Eponymy: having your name attached to a discovery (e.g. Halley's Comet, Planck's constant)
- Prizes (e.g. Nobel Prize)
- Nomination to societies (e.g. National Academy of Sciences)
- Publication

## Benefits of priority

> "Priority creates a privately-owned asset...from the very act of relinquishing exclusive possession of the knowledge" (Dasgupta and David 1994) 

## Benefits of priority
- Knowledge is public and accessible for others to use
- Scientist reputation increases the more new knowledge is used, thus capturing some of the externalities of new knowledge
- Making knowledge public allows other scientists to evaluate their work
- Scientists are incentivized to share their results in a timely fashion

## Why priority isn't perfect
- Incentives to be secretive remain, during research process or even after publication if scientist plans to build on published research
- "...imparts great significance to differences in timing that are inconsequential from
a societal standpoint" (Dasgupta and David 1994)
     + more than the socially optimal number of teams may choose to enter the same race, even though it only matters that one team makes the discovery
- The Matthew Effect (rich get richer and poor get poorer) - people pay more attention to scientists who already have a reputation, give them more credit than coauthors, give them more funding

## Prizes/contests
- Rewards for solving a specific problem 
- Examples: X-Prize for reusable spacecraft, Longitude prize for developing a way to determine longitude accurately

## Spaceshipone (winner of Ansari X-Prize)

## Question
- We've discussed the NIH system of disbursing grants, where grants are awarded based on what scientists consider to be important work. What is a potential advantage of prizes over this system?
     + Hint: consider the point of view of the senator from the podcast about the "shrimp fight club"

- What is a potential disadvantage?

## Do prizes work? - Historical evidence
- Historical evidence is mixed
- Some evidence that, in practice, prizes had many problems such as lobbying of judges,  difficulty deciding on the best submissions, and poor administration
- Example: For solving the problem of an effective safety lamp, uneducated George Stephenson was awarded about 100 pounds but well-connected Sir Humphry Davy was given 2000 pounds and public recognition of the achievement

## Do prizes work? - Historical evidence
- Brunt et al (2011) study awards given annually by the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) between 1839 and 1939
- Awards were either money and/or prestige
- They find that awards attracted more inventors for that category and increased patenting

## The size of contests
- A contest organizer may be concerned about the number of participants in the contest. Having more participants could increase the probability of reaching a better solution.
- Why could having fewer participants be beneficial from the organizer's point of view? 
    + Think of how a smaller contest affects a participant's chances of winning and their cost-benefit analysis

## TopCoder contests
- Solves software problems for companies by outsourcing the problem to independent programmers through competitions
- Contestants compete within a virtual "room" of no more than 20 coders, even though there could be more than 20 contestants in total
- Contestants can win money, recognition, and career opportunities 

## Boudreau et al (2011)
- Boudreau et al study TopCoder contests and find evidence consistent with both hypotheses
- When there are more competitors, effort decreases
- When there are more competitors, (at least) one competitor is likely to achieve a high-performing outcome
- Uncertainty/complexity of the problem matters: for more complex problems, having more competitors is more likely to yield a net benefit
