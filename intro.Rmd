## Goals of this class
- Learn about various economics issues affecting the United States
- Learn to make a well-supported argument in writing

## Some practical takeaways
- Be able to read commentary on economic studies in the news and understand (in broad terms) their strengths and flaws
- Know how to look up reliable research if you want to find out more about a topic

## Positive v.s. normative economics
- Positive: What is
    + Facts; does smoking cause cancer?
- Normative: What ought to be
    + Should smoking be banned?
    
## Motivated reasoning
- In this class, we will focus on what economics research says about *positive* questions, especially cause-and-effect
- Beware motivated reasoning: often what we think *should be* influences what we consider to be "facts"; you can always find a paper to support your views

## Guarding against motivated reasoning
- [David Leonhardt: Consider changing your mind about an issue you find complicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/opinion/a-summer-project-to-nourish-your-political-soul.html)
- Construct the best possible argument for the side you disagree with
