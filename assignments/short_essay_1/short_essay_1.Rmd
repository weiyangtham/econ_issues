## Minimum Wage
Imagine that researchers find that one year after Seattle completed its minimum wage increase to \$15/hour, employment and hours worked did not decrease, and wages increased. This implies that all cities should raise their minimum wage to the same level as Seattle's, *after adjusting for inflation*. Agree or disagree with this statement. 

## Immigration and agglomeration
There can be substantial economic benefits to having people and firms clustered together, also known as agglomeration economies. The existence of agglomeration economies implies that the United States should *open its borders completely* (but still barring criminals, terrorists, and those with serious communicable diseases). Agree or disagree with this statement.
