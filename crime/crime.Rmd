## Gary Becker

```

## Gary Becker

- 1992 Nobel prize in economics
- One of the pioneers in applying economics to topics more typically studied in sociology e.g. discrimination, crime, family/marriage, addiction
- Application of rational choice theory to different kinds of social issues

## Rationality

- What do economists mean by rationality?
- People choose the action/item that gives them the maximum net benefit
- This doesn't preclude people from doing things that others might think are bad for them; actions just need to consistent with the person's underlying preferences and constraints

## How can addiction be rational? (Becker and Murphy 1988)

- Addictive good: a good where utility is a function of previous consumption
- The amount of alcohol you've consumed in the past affects how you enjoy it in the future
    + Different individuals find different things addictive
- People choose to be addicted to a substance knowing that addiction will change their enjoyment of that good in the future i.e. they are accounting for future benefits and costs

## Question
- Does the Becker-Murphy theory of rational addiction seem plausible to you? What do you think is missing from it?

## Predictions
- How should we expect rational addicts to respond to prices?
- Addicts should respond to current and their *expectations* of future prices since they are forward-looking
- A lot of empirical work has focused on testing the relationship between future prices and current consumption

## Empirical challenge
- Suppose you have a dataset of cigarette prices and cigarette consumptions in each year
    + You find that there is a negative relationship between cigarette consumption and prices one year in advance
- What is the problem with using cigarette prices one year ahead to test the rational addiction theory?
    + Requires very sophisticated forecasts
    + Stockpiling (depends on the good)
    
<!-- 
realized prices not equal to expectations, also requires high sophistication
stockpiling

## Gruber and Koszegi 2000

- Use tax changes that are actually announced
- Use data on cigarette consumption rather than sales 
    + Vital Statistics Natality data which records, for every birth in America, whether the mother smokes and how much

## Findings
- Announced but not yet effective tax increases lead to both increased sales and decreased consumption of cigarettes
    + Consistent with forward-looking behavior

## Tax implications
- If cigarette consumption is rational, is there any justification for a tax on cigarettes?
    + Externalities
    
## Tax implications
- Hyperbolic discounting: a model where we place extra value on the present
    + If we value \$100 in 30 days and \$110 in 31 days equally, then we value \$100 today more than \$110 tomorrow
- Two selves: right now I would rather stay in and eat pizza, but I'll wake up early and work out tomorrow 
- If people are impatient, then optimal tax is greater than zero, even when there are no externalities
    + Intuition: "self-control" tax
- This can still be consistent with people being forward-looking

## Prohibition
- Definition: banning the sale of a product
- [The Economic Case Against Drug Prohibition](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.9.4.175)

## Prohibition: Supply and demand
- Legal punishment can be thought of as a "tax" on supply and demand
- Is the shift in demand likely to be large or small relative to the shift in supply?
    + Punishments tend to target suppliers
    + Suppliers more likely to face violence

## Violence
- Violence likely to increase if the marginal benefit to violence increases
- Why might the marginal benefit to violence increase?
    + Contract enforcement
- How do criminals govern themselves?
    + [The Invisible Hook by Peter Leeson](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Hook-Hidden-Economics-Pirates/dp/0691150095)
    
## Potency and quality
- Higher potency: easier to smuggle a flask than a keg
- But easier to overdose
- Quality: Reputation may still matter to some extent, but harder for consumers to complain about poor quality
- Increased accidental poisonings and overdoses

## Brief history of opioid epidemic
- In 1990s, pain was seen as a serious medical issue 
- Pharmaceutical companies developed and marketed drugs to doctors to treat pain
    + Based on misleading (or at best, overoptimistic) claims
- Pressure on doctors to treat pain quickly
    + Usually back pain especially is a difficult thing to treat
- Opioid users started moving to more potent opioids like heroin and fentanyl
    + Wanted a stronger high or lost access to painkillers

## Rethinking legalization/prohibition
- We've seen that prohibition, while well-intentioned, can lead to undesirable outcomes
- But the opioid crisis started with legal drugs
- Do you think hard drugs like heroin should be prohibited? You may also want to consider the different ways that prohibition can be executed as policy e.g. types of punishment, amount of policing

## Crime
- Deciding to commit a crime (or not) can be described as an investment decision
    + Trying to balance risk of getting caught and reward
- Idea came to Becker when he was trying to decide whether to park illegally

## [Quote from The Chicago Maroon](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/2012/05/25/the-economics-of-crime-with-gary-becker/)

> I was teaching at Columbia University and was driving to an oral exam with Ph.D. students. The question [I asked myself] was, “Should I park closer in a spot that was illegal, or should I park in a lot which was somewhat further away?” So I had to make a calculation: What was the likelihood that I’d be caught if I parked it down the street versus the time, the money, that would be lost by parking further away? I decided to park on the street, and since it was an oral exam, the first question I asked the student when my turn came to examine him on price theory was how he would handle a problem of this type.... I asked a lot of questions, and they didn’t do very well on it [laughs]. After I came out of the exam, I figured this is a really good problem to work on, so I started thinking more systematically about it.

## Problems with rationality
- Expected cost of committing a crime is $Prob(Caught) \times Punishment$
- In the [reading](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/09/what-was-gary-beckers-biggest-mistake.html), Tabarrok says that he is in favor of "quick, clear, and consistent" punishment (i.e. increasing $Prob(Caught)$) to deter crime
- How would you explain Tabarrok's argument using hyperbolic discounting?

## Fines v.s. Jail
- Suppose that a fine of $\$x$ is equivalent to $J$ years in jail
- Why does economic theory suggest that a fine of $\$2x$ is a stronger punishment than $2J$ years in jail?
    + Consider the timing of a fine v.s. the timing of being in jail
- Becker also argued that an advantage of fines over jail is that you have to pay for guards etc. to jail someone, but fines could be thought of as a form of compensation

## Policing
