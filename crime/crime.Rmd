## Gary Becker

- 1992 Nobel prize in economics
- One of the pioneers in applying economics to topics more typically studied in sociology e.g. discrimination, crime, family/marriage, addiction
- Application of rational choice theory to different kinds of social issues

## Rationality

- What do economists mean by rationality?
- People choose the action/item that gives them the maximum net benefit
- This doesn't preclude people from doing things that others might think are bad for them; actions just need to consistent with the person's underlying preferences and constraints
