## Gary Becker

- 1992 Nobel prize in economics
- One of the pioneers in applying economics to topics more typically studied in sociology e.g. discrimination, crime, family/marriage, addiction
- Application of rational choice theory to different kinds of social issues

## Rationality

- What do economists mean by rationality?
- People choose the action/item that gives them the maximum net benefit
- This doesn't preclude people from doing things that others might think are bad for them; actions just need to consistent with the person's underlying preferences and constraints

## How can addiction be rational? (Becker and Murphy 1988)

- Addictive good: a good where utility is a function of previous consumption
- The amount of alcohol you've consumed in the past affects how you enjoy it in the future
    + Different individuals find different things addictive
- People choose to be addicted to a substance knowing that addiction will change their enjoyment of that good in the future i.e. they are accounting for future benefits and costs

## Question
- Does the Becker-Murphy theory of rational addiction seem plausible to you? What do you think is missing from it?

## Predictions
- How should we expect rational addicts to respond to prices?
- Addicts should respond to current and their *expectations* of future prices since they are forward-looking
- A lot of empirical work has focused on testing the relationship between future prices and current consumption

## Empirical challenge
- Suppose you have a dataset of cigarette prices and cigarette consumptions in each year
    + You find that there is a negative relationship between cigarette consumption and prices one year in advance
- What is the problem with using cigarette prices one year ahead to test the rational addiction theory?
    + Requires very sophisticated forecasts
    + Stockpiling (depends on the good)
    
## Gruber and Koszegi 2000

- Use tax changes that are actually announced
- Use data on cigarette consumption rather than sales 
    + Vital Statistics Natality data which records, for every birth in America, whether the mother smokes and how much

## Findings
- Announced but not yet effective tax increases lead to both increased sales and decreased consumption of cigarettes
    + Consistent with forward-looking behavior

## Tax implications
- If cigarette consumption is rational, is there any justification for a tax on cigarettes?
    + Externalities
    
## Tax implications
- Hyperbolic discounting: a model where we place extra value on the present
    + If we value \$100 in 30 days to \$110 in 31 days, then we value \$100 today more than \$110 tomorrow
- If people are impatient, then optimal tax is greater than zero, even when there are no externalities
    + Intuition: "self-control" tax
- This can still be consistent with people being forward-looking

realized prices not equal to expectations, also requires high sophistication
