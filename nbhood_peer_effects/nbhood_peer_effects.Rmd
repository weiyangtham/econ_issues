## Neighborhood and peer effects

- Our earlier lecture focused on the role of geography in how knowledge workers interact
- Today: how does where you grow up, and who you grow up with, affect your long-term outcomes?

## Is the U.S. a "land of opportunity"?

> The U.S. is better described as a collection of societies, some
of which are “lands of opportunity” with high rates of mobility across generations, and others in which few children escape poverty (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez, 2014).

## Income mobility varies geographically

- The probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose

## Discussion
- Why does where you grow up matter?

1. Peer effects - your behaviors may be influenced by your peers e.g. studying, smoking
2. Role models
3. Better schools
4. Perception of future opportunities may influence current behavior
5. Environment could affect health outcomes

## Discussion
- What costs could there be from moving to a better neighborhood?

## Discussion
- If we want to know the effect of growing up in San Jose compared to Charlotte, why can't we just compare the outcomes of people who grow in San Jose and Charlotte?

## Moving to Opportunity (MTO) recap
- What was the Moving to Opportunity experiment?
- 4604 low-income families in 5 U.S. cities: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York
- 2 types of treatment groups (between 1994 to 1998):
    1. Subsidized housing voucher with requirement to move to a census tract with a poverty rate below 10\% (experimental voucher)
    2. Subsidized housing voucher with no additional requirements (section 8 voucher)
- Control group: no voucher, but retained access to public housing

## Early results of the MTO 
- Early results from Moving to Opportunity were "disappointing"
- Study of Boston MTO families 2 years after enrollment found improvements in safety, health, and behavior problems for boys, but no effect on employment, earnings, or welfare use (Katz, Kling, and Liebman, 2001)

## Maybe we just didn't wait long enough
- Ludwig et al (2013) look at outcomes 10-15 years after MTO
- Similar results: improvements in subjective well-being and mental health, but not in economic outcomes

## Maybe we just didn't wait long enough? Part 2
- Chetty et al focus on children who were younger than 13 at enrollment
- Children in treatment groups grew up in census tracts with lower poverty rates (19\% v.s. 29\% v.s. 41\%)

## Earnings increased

```

## Other outcomes of interest
- Likelihood of being a single parent was lower: why is this an outcome we might be interested in?

## Experimental v.s. Section 8 voucher
- In principle, Section 8 vouchers can move to the same places as experimental vouchers
- Encouraging or restricting families to move to better neighborhoods could be beneficial

## The younger you move to a better neighborhood, the better

```

## Conclusions
- Childhood exposure to low-poverty neighborhoods led to better outcomes in adulthood
- Effects on children's outcomes were not due to family income, since that did not improve
- Instead, they are likely to be driven by direct effects of neighborhood environments on the children or to be mediated by improved parental health and stress

## Further questions
- What makes a "good" neighborhood?
- How about the effects on "natives" i.e. people who were already in the neighborhood?
- In previous lectures, we've talked about the importance of knowledge workers

## What makes a good neighborhood?
- Chetty et al identify five factors *correlated* with income mobility [http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/)
1. Segregation
2. Income inequality 
3. School systems
4. Social capital e.g. number of religious individuals, participation in civic organizations
5. Family structure e.g. fraction of single parents in the area

## Cost-benefit analysis of MTO
- Suppose you are a policymaker interested in doing a cost-benefit analysis of the Moving to Opportunity program. What is a potential cost or benefit that is not studied in the Chetty et al paper? 
    + Hint: think of a group of people that hasn't been discussed yet

## Recall Clemens et al
- This paper tried to estimate the gain in wages for a foreigner working in the U.S.

## Wage premium from working the U.S.
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("placepremium.png")
```

## Discussion
- MTO is essentially an immigration experiment, albeit within the U.S.
- Knowing what you know from the MTO experiment, why might the place premium (assuming it's 100\% accurate!) understate the gains to immigration for immigrants?

## Costs of moving

- Perhaps there are disruption costs
