## Neighborhood and peer effects

- Our earlier lecture focused on the role of geography in how knowledge workers interact
- Today: how does where you grow up, and who you grow up with, affect your long-term outcomes?

## Is the U.S. a "land of opportunity"?

> The U.S. is better described as a collection of societies, some
of which are “lands of opportunity” with high rates of mobility across generations, and others in which few children escape poverty (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez, 2014).

## Income mobility varies geographically

- The probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose

## Income mobility varies geographically

```

## Discussion
- Why does where you grow up matter?

1. Peer effects - your behaviors may be influenced by your peers e.g. studying, smoking
2. Role models
3. Better schools
4. Perception of future opportunities may influence current behavior
5. Environment could affect health outcomes

## Discussion
- What costs could there be from moving to a better neighborhood?

## Discussion
- If we want to know the effect of growing up in San Jose compared to Charlotte, why can't we just compare the outcomes of people who grow in San Jose and Charlotte?

## Moving to Opportunity (MTO) recap
- What was the Moving to Opportunity experiment?
- 4604 low-income families in 5 U.S. cities: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York
- 2 types of treatment groups (between 1994 to 1998):
    1. Subsidized housing voucher with requirement to move to a census tract with a poverty rate below 10\% (experimental voucher)
    2. Subsidized housing voucher with no additional requirements (section 8 voucher)
- Control group: no voucher, but retained access to public housing

## Early results of the MTO 
- Early results from Moving to Opportunity were "disappointing"
- Study of Boston MTO families 2 years after enrollment found improvements in safety, health, and behavior problems for boys, but no effect on employment, earnings, or welfare use (Katz, Kling, and Liebman, 2001)

## Maybe we just didn't wait long enough
- Ludwig et al (2013) look at outcomes 10-15 years after MTO
- Similar results: improvements in subjective well-being and mental health, but not in economic outcomes

## Maybe we just didn't wait long enough? Part 2
- Chetty et al focus on children who were younger than 13 at enrollment
- Children in treatment groups grew up in census tracts with lower poverty rates (19\% v.s. 29\% v.s. 41\%)

## Earnings increased
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("mto_average_earnings.png")
```

## Other outcomes of interest
- Likelihood of being a single parent was lower: why is this an outcome we might be interested in?

## Experimental v.s. Section 8 voucher
- In principle, Section 8 vouchers can move to the same places as experimental vouchers
- Encouraging or restricting families to move to better neighborhoods could be beneficial

## The younger you move to a better neighborhood, the better
```{r, fig.align='center'}

```

## Conclusions
- Childhood exposure to low-poverty neighborhoods led to better outcomes in adulthood
- Effects on children's outcomes were not due to family income, since that did not improve
- Instead, they are likely to be driven by direct effects of neighborhood environments on the children or to be mediated by improved parental health and stress

## Further questions
- What makes a "good" neighborhood?
- How about the effects on "natives" i.e. people who were already in the neighborhood?
- In previous lectures, we've talked about the importance of knowledge workers

## What makes a good neighborhood?
- Chetty et al identify five factors *correlated* with income mobility [http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/)
1. Segregation
2. Income inequality 
3. School systems
4. Social capital e.g. number of religious individuals, participation in civic organizations
5. Family structure e.g. fraction of single parents in the area

## Recall Clemens et al
- This paper tried to estimate the gain in wages for a foreigner working in the U.S.

## Wage premium from working in the U.S.
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("placepremium.png")
```

## Discussion
- MTO is essentially an immigration experiment, albeit within the U.S.
- Knowing what you know from the MTO experiment, why might only looking at the place premium causes us to understate the gains to immigration for immigrants?

<!-- think of the children! -->

## Cost-benefit analysis of MTO
- Suppose you are a policymaker interested in doing a cost-benefit analysis of the Moving to Opportunity program. What is a potential cost or benefit that is not studied in the Chetty et al paper? 
    + Hint: think of a group of people that hasn't been discussed yet

## Katrina's Children
- In 2005, Hurrican Katrina forced many schools to close for an extended period of time, such that 188 000 public school students had to be enrolled in new schools
- Since the students had to be enrolled quickly, parents did not have time to be selective about schools, and schools did not have time to be selective about students

## Research question
- Imberman, Kugler, and Sacerdote use this natural experiment to study *peer effects* in schools

## Question
- What hypotheses can you come up with of how the ability of your peers could affect your own academic performance?

## Hypotheses
1. Monotonic model - performance improves with quality of peers
2. Invidious comparison model - performance is harmed by having peers that are more able
3. Ability grouping - performances improves when peers are equally able to you

## Results
- On average, influx of students did not hurt grades, but there were negative effects on attendance and behavior
- Most consistent with monotonic model - academic performance improved with quality of peers

## Explaining the monotonic model
- The monotonic model could be operate two ways. One is the direct effect of peers e.g. high-achieving peers can help learning in the classroom. What is an indirect way the monotonic model could work? 
    + Hint: who else is in the classroom?

## Discussion
- What concerns do you have about this study? 
    + Think about the inputs into the "education production function"

## Neighborhoods and innovation
- We've touched on the importance of innovators in previous lectures. Immigration is often suggested as one way to increase the supply of innovators in the U.S. 
- Another way could be to increase the supply of innovators from people born in the U.S.

## Children of high-income parents are more likely to become inventors
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("patentrate_parentsincome.png")
```

## Discussion
- Children of top 1\% parents are 10 times more likely to patent than children of parents with below-median income. What are some possible reasons for this pattern?
- What are the policy implications for these reasons?

<!--
(innate) ability
education
role models
neighborhoods
job opportunities
discrimination

policy implications: if not all ability, then there is scope for policy to increase supply of inventors
-->

## Is it "ability"?
- Use 3rd grade math test scores as a proxy for ability
- Compare probability of becoming an inventor for children with the same early childhood test scores but different parental incomes

## High-scoring, "poor" children less likely to be inventors
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("math_inventor.png")
```

## How about barriers due to race?
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("mathscores_race.png")
```

## "Rational Sorting" models
- Can think of the racial barriers to becoming an inventor as additional cost or tax of becoming an inventor
- Suppose the gains to becoming an inventor are higher for high-ability individuals
- What does that imply about the ability level of inventors of different races? 
    + Hint: think about whether inventors of different races will have different ability levels
    + Even if the costs of becoming an inventor are higher, returns are still high enough for high-ability individuals so they still choose to be inventors
    
## Test of the rational sorting model

## Costs of moving
- Slightly negative effects for those aged 13-19 at RA
- Perhaps there are disruption costs
