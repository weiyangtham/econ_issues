## Neighborhood and peer effects

- Our earlier lecture focused on the interaction of knowledge workers
- Today: how does where you grow up, and who you grow up with, affect your long-term outcomes?

## Is the U.S. a "land of opportunity"?

> The U.S. is better described as a collection of societies, some
of which are “lands of opportunity” with high rates of mobility across generations, and others in which few children escape poverty (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez).

## Income mobility varies geographically

- The probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose

## Question
- It seems reasonable to think that the neighborhood you grow up in could affect your adult outcomes
- Why can't we just compare people who grow up
