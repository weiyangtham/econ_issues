## Recap: "Furious Five"

1. Regression
2. Randomization
3. Instrumental variables
4. Difference-in-differences
5. Regression Discontinuity

- If you want to learn more, look up the book "Master 'Metrics" by Josh Angrist and Steve Pischke

## Recap: Instrumental Variables
- Suppose you are trying to study the effect of going to college on earnings. You can think of college as the "treatment". 
- In this context, what would a good instrument do?

## Recap: Difference-in-differences
- What is the key assumption behind difference-in-differences? 
    + This is known as the parallel trends assumption
- What is one way we can check if this assumption is violated?

## Recap: Regression Discontinuity
- A regression discontinuity compares people just above and just below a threshold. What would invalidate this strategy?

## Recap: all methods
- What is a common concern for any method we use?
    + External validity

## Background
- Established in 1938 with the **Fair Labor Standards Act** at $0.25/hour
- Current federal minimum wage is \$7.25 (since 2009)
- 22 states have higher minimum wage than federal; 5 states have no minimum wage
- Seattle is increasing its minimum wage to \$15/hr, which would make it the highest in the U.S.

## Economic theory and the minimum wage
What does classical supply and demand predict will be the effect of introducing a minimum wage in an economy that does not have a minimum wage?

- Standard supply and demand predicts that fewer workers will be employed after instituting a minimum wage

## Card and Krueger
- In 1992, New Jersey raised its minimum wage from \$4.25 to \$5.05 per hour
- Card and Krueger surveyed fast food restaurants in New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania before and after the minimum wage increase

## Question
- What was the research design of Card and Krueger? Did they use instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or difference-in-differences?

## Main result
- No evidence of decrease in employment; in fact Card and Krueger find an increase in employment at restaurants affected by the minimum wage

## Question
- Recall our lecture on methods in empirical economics. What is the key assumption of the method Card and Krueger used? 
- Can we verify this assumption with the data Card and Krueger collected?

## Evidence since Card and Krueger
- Card and Krueger was a landmark paper, but it is only one result

## Survey
- Were you surprised by this graph?

## Question
- Schmitt discusses 3 different models for explaining the "zero effect" of the minimum wage. What are they?

## Explaining the zero effect on employment
- Monopsony model
- Channels of adjustment (Competitive model)
- Institutional model

## Monopsony
- What is a monopsony?
- Hint: reverse of a monopoly

## Dynamic Monopsony
- Monopsony model differs from classical model by allowing for "frictions" - it takes time, effort, resources for workers to find jobs, and for firms to fill vacancies
- This results in firms being price-setters, not price-takers 
- Firms have some market power and are able to pay workers below their marginal product

## Monopsony - blackboard

## Competitive Model - Alternative channels of adjustment 
- Classical model generally implies firms will reduce employment
- Instead of reducing employment, firms could respond to minimum wage in other ways
- Examples: Reduce health insurance, training, increase prices

## Institutional model
- Firms adopt (costly) practices to increase productivity 
- Efficiency wages - workers increase productivity in response to higher wages
- Higher minimum wage increases purchasing power of low-wage workers, offsetting the increase in labor costs

## Early evidence from Seattle
- Seattle raised minimum wage from \$9.47 to \$11 per hour in 2015, and to \$13 per hour in 2016
- Seattle commissioned a study on the effects of the minimum wage hike

## What's unique about the Seattle study?
- The data: Washington state collects data on both earnings *and* hours for individual workers
- Previous studies have less detailed data; typical approach was to look at employment for restaurant industry. What might be wrong with this?

## Seattle methodology
- "Synthetic Control"
- Essentially a difference-in-differences
- The control group is a weighted combination of counties around Seattle

## Question
- Does the control group for Seattle seem reasonable to you?

## Seattle methodology
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("seattle_synthweights.pdf")
```

## Key results
- Zero employment effects in the restaurant industry, consistent with earlier studies
- BUT hours worked fell by 9\% in the second phase, so total earnings fell by \$125 a month

## Challenges to the study
- 

## Group Discussion
- Does zero employment effect mean we should implement minimum wage?
