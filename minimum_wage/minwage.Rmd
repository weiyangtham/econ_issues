## Background
- Established in 1938 with the **Fair Labor Standards Act** at $0.25/hour
- Current federal minimum wage is $7.25 (since 2009)
- 22 states have higher minimum wage than federal; 5 states have no minimum wage
- Seattle is increasing its minimum wage to $15/hr, which would make it the highest in the U.S. 

## Minimum wage by state
```{r, out.width="800px", out.height="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("state_minwage.png")
```

## Real of minimum wage has been flat 
```{r fed_minwage, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)

fed_minwage = read_csv("minimum_wage/fed_minwage.csv")
cpi = read_csv("minimum_wage/cpi.csv")

minwage = inner_join(fed_minwage, cpi, by = "DATE") %>% 
  mutate(year = year(DATE)) %>% 
  rename(wage = FEDMINNFRWG, cpi2010 = CPALTT01USA661S)

minwage %<>% mutate(wage_real = wage/cpi2010)

minwage %>% gather(k, minwage, wage, wage_real) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, minwage, colour = k)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "in $2010")

```

## Economic theory and the minimum wage
- What does classical supply and demand predict will be the effect of introducing a minimum wage in an economy that does not have a minimum wage?

## Economic theory and the minimum wage
What does standard supply and demand predict will be the effect of introducing a minimum wage in an economy that does not have a minimum wage?

- Standard supply and demand predicts that fewer workers will be employed after instituting a minimum wage

## Experimental design
- What would your ideal minimum wage experiment look like?

## Card and Krueger
- In 1992, New Jersey raised its minimum wage from \$4.25 to \$5.05 per hour
- Surveyed fast food restaurants in New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania before and after the minimum wage increase
- No evidence of decrease in employment

## Evidence since Card and Krueger
- Card and Krueger was a landmark paper, but it is only one result
- Many studies since have concluded that the minimum wage has no effect, or a small effect that is too difficult to detect

## Other studies on the minimum wage
