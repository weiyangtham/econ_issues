## Background
- Established in 1938 with the **Fair Labor Standards Act** at $0.25/hour
- Current federal minimum wage is $7.25 (since 2009)
- 22 states have higher minimum wage than federal; 5 states have no minimum wage
- Seattle is increasing its minimum wage to $15/hr, which would make it the highest in the U.S. 

## Minimum wage by state
```{r, out.width="800px", out.height="500px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("state_minwage.png")
```

## Real value of minimum wage has been flat 
```{r fed_minwage, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align ='center'}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)

fed_minwage = read_csv("minimum_wage/fed_minwage.csv")
cpi = read_csv("minimum_wage/cpi.csv")

minwage = inner_join(fed_minwage, cpi, by = "DATE") %>% 
  mutate(year = year(DATE)) %>% 
  rename(wage = FEDMINNFRWG, cpi2010 = CPALTT01USA661S)

minwage %<>% mutate(wage_real = wage/cpi2010)

minwage %>% gather(k, minwage, wage, wage_real) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, minwage, colour = k)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_colour_discrete(guide = FALSE) + 
  annotate("text", x = 1987, y = 8.75, label = "Real Min Wage", size = 5) + 
  annotate("text", x = 1999, y = 3.75, label = "Nominal Min Wage", size = 5) +

## Economic theory and the minimum wage
What does classical supply and demand predict will be the effect of introducing a minimum wage in an economy that does not have a minimum wage?

- Standard supply and demand predicts that fewer workers will be employed after instituting a minimum wage

## Card and Krueger
- In 1992, New Jersey raised its minimum wage from \$4.25 to \$5.05 per hour
- Surveyed fast food restaurants in New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania before and after the minimum wage increase

## Question
- What was the research design of Card and Krueger? That is, did they use instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or difference-in-differences?

## Main result
- No evidence of decrease in employment; in fact Card and Krueger find an increase in employment at restaurants affected by the minimum wage

## Evidence since Card and Krueger
- Card and Krueger was a landmark paper, but it is only one result

## Other studies on the minimum wage

```

## Explaining the zero effect on employment
- Monopsony model
- Channels of adjustment (Competitive model)
- Institutional model

## Monopsony
- Monopsony model differs from classical model by allowing for "frictions" - it takes time, effort, resources for workers to find jobs, and for firms to fill vacancies
- This results in firms being price-setters, not price-takers 
- Firms have some market power and are able to pay workers below their marginal product

## Competitive Model - Alternative channels of adjustment 
- Classical model generally implies firms will reduce employment
- Instead of reducing employment, firms could respond to minimum wage in other ways
- Examples: Reduce health insurance, training, increase prices

## Institutional model
- Firms adopt (costly) practices to increase productivity 
- Efficiency wages - workers increase productivity in response to higher wages
- Higher minimum wage increases purchasing power of low-wage workers, offsetting the increase in labor costs

## Does zero employment effect mean we should implement minimum wage?
- essay?

## Early evidence from Seattle
- Seattle raised minimum wage from \$9.47 to \$11 per hour in 2015, and to \$13 per hour in 2016.
