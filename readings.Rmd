This is a tentative list of readings that I will update as the course progresses. I will add articles to "old" topics (i.e. topics we have already discussed) so it will be helpful for you to refer to the list now and then, especially when you are looking for sources for your essay assignments. I have also included a section on sources of and about economics research. 

## Helpful sources

- [Journal of Economics Perspectives](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/jep/about-jep) provides overviews of research topics and targeted at non-specialists
- The [National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)](www.nber.org) is a great resource for the latest working papers in economics. The [NBER Digest](http://www.nber.org/digest/) provides non-technical summaries of papers. 
- [Microeconomic Insights](http://microeconomicinsights.org/) provides summaries of the latest economics research
