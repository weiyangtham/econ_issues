```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Why write?

1. **Writing is thinking!**
2. Communicate your ideas

## How to approach the assignments
- Think of writing as first and foremost a way to organize and refine your thoughts
- Good, clear writing will emerge as a consequence of that

## What we think good writing looks like
```{r, fig.align='default'}
knitr::include_graphics("usainbolt.jpg")
```

## What it actually is
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("qwop.jpg")
```

## Embrace the process
- Good writing is recursive, not linear
- Linear process: research > outline > draft > edit > submit
- Recursive: anything goes
    + might write an outline then decide you need more research
    + might completely reorganize your paper and change your argument 
    
## Embrace the process
- It can feel like "one step forward, two steps back"...
- But that's how you know you're learning!

## Some tips
1. Start early
2. Just write; you can't edit what isn't written down. 
    + Good "writing" is really good editing
    + Writer's block is not real
3. Use writing to work through your thoughts. Don't feel that you need a fully-formed argument before starting on a paper

## Guidelines for good writing
1. Be clear and concise 
    - Eliminate unnecessary words, sentences, or paragraphs
2. Get to the point 
    - Once you've provided enough context, layout your thesis as quickly as possible
3. Flow 
    - A sentence/paragraph should follow logically from the previous one
4. Be concrete 
    - Show, don't tell
    - Use examples, figures, and facts
    - A good figure can say a lot!

## How to pick a topic
Ideal topic for this class

1. Something you're interested in
2. Something you're unsure about i.e. don't choose an issue where you would never be willing to change your mind
3. There is a substantial amount of research on this topic that you can draw upon

## Some practical steps for picking a topic
- Make a list of issues you're interested in
- Do a little bit of background reading and see if there are questions about that issue you find interesting
- When you have one or two topics in mind, I recommend that you run them by me. I have office hours...make use of them!

## Example: Tenure in academia
- What is tenure?   
- Why do universities give professors tenure? 
- Two Primary Research Questions: 
    + Does tenure increase educational quality?  
    + Does tenure increase research quality?
- Theory: How could tenure affect incentives for teaching/research?
- Empirics: In what ways is the best empirical evidence consistent (or not) with these predictions?

## Finding resources
- Look at our reading list and the resources listed there
- Journal of Economic Perspectives is a great place to start
- Make use of non-technical summaries (e.g. NBER Digest, Microeconomics Insights blog)

## Citations

- A common mistake is to use quotes way too frequently
- Just relay the important info and cite it appropriately
- Examples:
    + Tergimann (2015) finds that self-employed earn on average 15% less than their wage-employed counterparts. 
    + Self-employed men earn 15% less on average than their wage-employed counterparts (Tergimann, 2015).
- Use the authors' last name to identify them and do not give their academic affiliation.
    + What not to do: According to Wei Yang Tham (2016), a graduate student at Ohio State University...
    + Do this instead: Tham (2016) finds...
