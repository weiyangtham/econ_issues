## Roadmap

- Externalities
- Tragedy of the commons
- Estimating the costs of pollution 
    + Effects of air pollution on health
    + Climate change (Stern review)
- Solutions
    + Tax
    + Cap and trade

## Reading Discussion
- In the Planet Money podcast, you heard two views on the relationship between economic growth and the environment

1. We should stop trying to achieve economic growth because of the harm to the environment and because the world is already prosperous enough

2. We should not stop economic growth, economic growth can be environmentally sustainable

- Which view do you agree with more? Why?

## Economist's perspective on enviroment/natural resources
- Pollution is not pleasant
- What is the optimal amount of pollution? Is it zero?
- To determine optimal amount of pollution, have to estimate marginal costs of pollution and marginal benefits of actions that produce pollution

## Market failure
- Externalities
- Tragedy of the commons

## Externalities
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("externalities.png")
```

## Externalities
- External costs to producing a good that the producer does not take into account
- Leads to over-production of the good

## Solution: tax
- Pigouvian tax (named after Arthur Pigou) - tax that forces market external cost to be internalized
- What are some practical challenges of implementing a Pigouvian tax?
    + Hard to determine magnitude of tax
    + Political feasibility?

## Private v.s. common property
- Private property: What you own e.g. the place you live
- Common property: owned with others e.g. neighborhood park

## Private property
```{r, fig.align='center'}

```

## Common property
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("dirtysink.jpg")
```

## Tragedy of the commons
- No clear property rights
- If nobody owns the forest then the loggers will not fully internalize the cost of consuming resources
    + Each logger gets the profits from whatever timber he takes
    + While all loggers bear the burden of the reduced stock of trees
    + Other examples: overfishing
- The private benefit from the commons is not enough to compensate any given individual for the cost of maintaining the common resource
    + Even though the social benefit is worth the cost of maintenance

## Ronald Coase
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("coase_portrait.jpg")
```

## Coase Theorem
If

1. Transaction costs are zero (or "low enough")
2. Full information

- Regardless of how property rights are assigned, bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome

## Coase Theorem
- Transcation costs are rarely (or never) 0
- The theorem doesn't say anything about who should get property rights and therefore profits 
    + Redistribution problem

## Coase Theorem in action: Cap-and-trade
- "Cap": government limits the level of pollution allowed i.e. a pollution quota
- "Trade": government issues rights to pollute; firms can trade these rights
- Reduce the cap over time

## 1990 Clean Air Act
- Purpose: acid rain reduction from sulphur dioxide emissions
- Each permit grants its holder 1 ton of sulphur dioxide emissions
- Generally regarded as successful in meeting quotas
    + Helped by decrease in price of natural gas (which is a cleaner fuel) after 2008
    
## Sulphur dioxide emissions in the U.S.
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("so2_emissions.png")
```

## European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)
- Cap-and-trade for carbon emissions
- [Mixed success](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/20/europes-cap-and-trade-program-is-in-trouble-can-it-be-fixed/)
- Seems to have succeeded in reducing emissions BUT
- Gave too many permits, leading to extremely low carbon prices

## ETS carbon prices
```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("ets_carbonprice.png")
```

## Effects of air pollution
Difficulties of estimating effect of air pollution
- Places with higher pollution are different in other ways e.g. higher density, different economic conditions 
- People who live in places with higher pollution are different
- Difficult to measure lifetime exposure to pollution
- Establishing a counterfactual: How much earlier are people dying due to increased air pollution? Would they have died a few days later anyway?

## [Chay and Greenstone (2003)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6822135.pdf)
- Natural experiment: 1981-1982 recession; different geographic areas affected by recession to different degrees
- Study infant mortality: measuring lifetime exposure to pollution may be less of a problem

## Change in pollution levels
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("chaygreenstone_tsps.png")
```

## Change in infant mortality
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("chaygreenstone_infantmort.png")
```

## Change in per capita income
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("chaygreenstone_income.png")
```

## Is it a valid (natural) experiment?
- Pollution levels in different counties were affected differently
- Infant mortality seemed to be affected substantially
- Main concern: infant mortality was affected by other factors, like income
    + Income did not change as abruptly as pollution or infant mortality
    
## Takeaways
- Significant effects of pollution on infant outcomes, especially deaths occuring within 24 hours and birth weight
    + Suggests fetal exposure during pregnancy is an important channel for these effects
- Estimate that 2500 fewer infants would have died in absence of reductions in air pollution

## Climate change: The Stern Review

- Stern Review is a 700 page economic analysis of climate change
- Conclusion: "...the benefits of strong, early action on climate change outweighs the costs."
- Simulations of a model of economic growth and climate dynamics

## Critcisms
- [Review of the Stern Review by Martin Weitzman](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.45.3.703) 
- Conclusion of the Stern review depends too heavily on the discount rate
- Claim is that the Stern discount rate is too low i.e. it assumes that we place a high value on future outcomes and outcomes of future generations
- But could still be "right for the wrong reasons" 
    + Current approaches not good at accounting for extreme events
    + We need better empirical understanding of catastrophic outcomes e.g. how possible is it to have early detection of a catastrophe?

## Takeaways
- Conceptual issues in environmental economics: externalities, tragedy of the commons
- Two common solutions: Pigouvian tax and cap-and-trade
- Empirical issues: how to measure costs and benefits of environmental damage or environmental policies
- Approaches: 
    + Quasi-experimental 
    + Simulations of economic models
    + Both have value

oil spills - GDP doesn't take into account all relevant costs - like pollution

robert mendelson, nordhaus
death, illnesses, loss of visibility (scenery)
compensating differentials - people who take risky jobs v.s. less risky jobs
GED - gross external damage; "bad" industries like coal-fired power plants
how to internalize external costs 

herman daly - can never count all negative externalities
just stop growth
is that fair?

mendelson
- more services from less material
