## Markets without prices

- Prices are usually involved when we think of markets
    + In equilibrium, the market clears
- What happens if there are no prices? E.g. the market for kidneys

## Matching and market design
- Figuring out how to make price-less markets more efficient has been one of economics's biggest successes in recent history
- An underlying question here is: what are the characteristics of a properly functioning market?
    + Primary goal is to have a thick market: bring together many participants (on both sides of the market) so that they have opportunities to find the best transactions

## What could cause a market to fail?
- Unraveling: an advantage to making an early offer snowballs as competitors keep trying to be slightly earlier than each other
- Congestion: too many options that are difficult to evaluate
- Safe and simple (strategy-proof): participants can list their true preferences instead of trying to game the system

## The Kidney Market 
- In most countries, it is illegal to sell human organs; supply of organs comes from donations
- Kidneys are a special case because you have two kidneys and can donate one without having to be dead
- Dialysis is costly, taxing on patients, and not a long-term solution; a transplant is the best bet
- Nonetheless, kidneys are not typically exempted from laws prohibiting the sale of human organs...

## ...except in Iran!
- Iran allows payments, usually several thousand dollars
- Iran has no kidney transplant waiting list
- Contrast with U.S. which has over 100 000 patients on the wait list
    + Wait time is 3-5 years, with estimated mortality rate of 5\% before receiving a kidney
    
## Group Discussion
In groups of 3-4, discuss: 

- Would you support legalizing kidney sales? Why or why not?
  
## Kidney exchange
- Even if you can find a donor willing to donate to you, donors and recipients have to be compatible
- If you are an incompatible donor-recipient pair, you could still get your transplant by finding a another donor-recipient pair willing to trade 
- This is like a barter transaction (5 homemade jams for a leg of ham)
    + Relies on "double coincidence of wants" - you have to want jam and I have to want ham
    + If you pay me with money, I can just buy something else later if I don't want ham

## 3-way Kidney Exchange

```

## Trading cycles
- The logic of the pairwise kidney exchange can be extended to trading cycles involving three or more donor-recipient pairs
- Donors without a recipient can kick off a cycle (technically a chain since they don't need to receive a kidney), thus giving their donation even greater value
- Donors without recipients also reduce harm if someone in the chain backs out

## Congestion
- In the early days of kidney exchange, surgery to perform the swaps was done simulataneously, making long trading cycles a logistical challenge
- Why do you think surgeries were done simultaneously?

## Safe and simple
- You might imagine designing a kidney exchange algorithm that prioritized patients with only one donor, since they would have a harder time trying to find someone to make an exchange with. 
- Why might this backfire and make the exchange less thick?

## Making kidney exchange work as a market
- Market thickness 
    + Assembling databases of patient-donor pairs
- Congestion 
    + At first, scheduling simultaneous surgeries to protect against people backing out; now, organizing chains
- Safe and simple 
    + Making it easy for hospitals and patients to enroll and reveal important information
    
## Boston Public Schools (BPS) system
- Another prominent example of the usefulness of market design
- Problem with the old system was that it required parents to be strategic
- Parents who were less savvy ended up with schools nowhere near the top of their list; parents who were savvy expended lots of effort trying to game the system (e.g. talking to other parents at the playground to figure out demand for kindergartens)

## Priority
- Old Boston algorithm was based on a combination of how you ranked the school and priority
- Priority means that if you and another person both ranked a school as your first choice but you have priority, you get admitted over that person
- Priority was based on having siblings in a school, living within the walk zone of a school, and a lottery

## Old Boston algorithm

1. Families list at least 3 schools in order of preference
2. School *immediately* admits all first choice students in order of priority up to capacity, then rejects the rest
3. Algorithm assigns as many remaining students as possible to their second choice 
4. Algorithm assigns as many remaining students as possible to their third choice 
5. ...

- Students who don't get any of their choices are assigned to the nearest school with vacant seats

## Problems with old algorithm
- Consider a child who lives within the walk zone of a popular kindergarten, and this kindergarten is their parent's second choice
- Their first choice kindergarten is a more distant kindergarten that's just as popular
- Two possible actions: 
    1. List the distant kindergarten as their first choice (i.e. list their true preferences)
    2. List the walk zone kindergarten as their first choice
    
## If parents list true preferences

1. Distant kindergarten: unlikely to get since they don't have priority
2. Walk zone kindergarten: Since it is also popular, it has probably filled its places with students who put it as their first choice
3. Kindergarten X: Unlikely to get third choice either, since it will have to have vacancies after accepting students who listed it as their first or second choice
4. Same as 3.
5. ...

## If parents list true preferences

- Either get lucky and get the (first choice) distant kindergarten
- If not, don't get any of their choices and end up with an unpopular school 

## Parents act strategically
- Instead of listing their true preferences, parents would instead list the kindergarten where they had walk zone priority i.e. their listed top choice is not their actual top choice
- This is a difficult thing to spot since we can't observe true preferences
- 80\% of children were being assigned to schools that their parents had listed first, so the system looked like it was successful

## Deferred acceptance in Boston

1. Each student "proposes" to their first choice. Each school tentatively assigns its seats to its proposers one at a time in their priority order. Any remaining proposers are rejected.

2. Rejected students propose to their next choice. Each school considers the students it had tentatively "accepted" together with the new proposals and assigns its seats in order of priority. Any remaining proposers are rejected. 

3. Repeat until no student proposal is rejected and each student is tentatively assigned a school

- If a student doesn't get their first choice, they can still get into their second choice 

## Advantage of deferred acceptance
- Resulting matches are stable: there is no student and school that would would rather be together than with their matched partner (think of priorities as the school's preferences)
- If a student doesn't get into a school they wanted to go to, it must be because they were lower priority
- If a school doesn't get a student they wanted, it must be because the student didn't apply since the school would have accepted them
