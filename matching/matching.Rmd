## Markets without prices

- Prices are usually involved when we think of markets
    + In equilibrium, the market clears
- What happens if there are no prices? E.g. the market for kidneys

## Matching and market design
- Figuring out how to make price-less markets more efficient has been one of economics's biggest successes in recent history
- An underlying question here is: what are the characteristics of a properly functioning market?
    + Primary goal is to have a thick market: bring together many participants (on both sides of the market) so that they have opportunities to find the best transactions

## What could cause a market to fail?
- Unraveling: an advantage to making an early offer snowballs as competitors keep trying to be slightly earlier than each other
- Congestion: too many options that are difficult to evaluate
- Safe and simple (strategy-proof): participants can list their true preferences instead of trying to game the system

## The Kidney Market 
- In most countries, it is illegal to sell human organs; supply of organs comes from donations
- Kidneys are a special case because you have two kidneys and can donate one without having to be dead
- Dialysis is costly, taxing on patients, and not a long-term solution; a transplant is the best bet
- Nonetheless, kidneys are not typically exempted from laws prohibiting the sale of human organs...

## ...except in Iran!
- Iran allows payments, usually several thousand dollars
- Iran has no kidney transplant waiting list
- Contrast with U.S. which has over 100 000 patients on the wait list
    + Wait time is 3-5 years, with estimated mortality rate of 5\% before receiving a kidney
    
## Group Discussion
In groups of 3-4, discuss: 

- Would you support legalizing kidney sales? Why or why not?
  
## Kidney exchange
- Even if you can find a donor willing to donate to you, donors and recipients have to be compatible
- If you are an incompatible donor-recipient pair, you could still get your transplant by finding a another donor-recipient pair willing to trade 
- This is like a barter transaction (5 homemade jams for a leg of ham)
    + Relies on "double coincidence of wants" - you have to want jam and I have to want ham
    + If you pay me with money, I can just buy something else later if I don't want ham

```

## Trading cycles
- The logic of the pairwise kidney exchange can be extended to trading cycles involving three or more donor-recipient pairs
- Donors without a recipient can kick off a cycle (technically a chain since they don't need to receive a kidney), thus giving their donation even greater value
- Donors without recipients also reduce harm if someone in the chain backs out

## Congestion
- In the early days of kidney exchange, surgery to perform the swaps was done simulataneously, making long trading cycles a logistical challenge
- Why do you think surgeries were done simultaneously?

## Safe and simple
- You might imagine designing a kidney exchange algorithm that prioritized patients with only one donor, since they would have a harder time trying to find someone to make an exchange with. 
- Why might this backfire and make the exchange less thick?

## Making kidney exchange work as a market
- Market thickness 
    + Assembling databases of patient-donor pairs
- Congestion 
    + At first, scheduling simultaneous surgeries to protect against people backing out; now, organizing chains
- Safe and simple 
    + Making it easy for hospitals and patients to enroll and reveal important information
    
## Boston Public Schools (BPS) system
- Another prominent example of the usefulness of market design
